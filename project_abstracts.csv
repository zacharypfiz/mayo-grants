Francis Baffour; Hao Gong,AI-assisted quantitative photon-counting-detector CT imaging for cytogenetic risk prediction and treatment response in multiple myeloma,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Focal bone marrow biopsies of the posterior iliac crest are the gold standard for diagnosing multiple
myeloma, yet they do not reflect the spatial and genomic heterogeneity of the disease. Almost 25% of
such patients do not have adequate samples for cytogenetic assessment need for risk stratification.
This inconsistency in bone marrow sampling could result in falsely reassuring prognoses for patients
with aggressive disease. Whole-body imaging presents an unrealized opportunity to derive image
features in the bone marrow that reflect the cytogenetic diversity of clonal plasma cells. Several
advanced imaging modalities are used for diagnosis and disease management. An alternative
approach is to optimize one imaging modality for these tasks. Recently FDA approved photon-
counting detector (PCD)-CT has technological advancements that permit simultaneous bone marrow
composition quantification and lytic lesion detection throughout the whole skeleton. In addition, the
quantitative accuracy of the spectral data can be used to determine changes in bone marrow and
intralesional fat fraction, an indicator of treatment response. This proposal’s specific objective is to
develop imaging based cytogenetic risk stratification models and a quantitative PCD-CT mechanism
to accurately measure bone marrow composition. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep-
learning (DL) imaging-model for multiple myeloma cytogenetic risk stratification. In Aim 2, we will
develop and validate physics-informed DL-assisted material decomposition to derive imaging
biomarkers of multiple myeloma. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical feasibility of the DL
cytogenetic risk prediction model and imaging biomarkers for multiple myeloma prognostication and
assessing response to therapy. This PCD-CT protocol will be a “one-stop shop” multiple myeloma
tool for disease detection, prognostication, and treatment response assessment. The innovation of
this proposal includes our development of an imaging protocol that leverages the many technical
improvements of PCD-CT, AI image processing, and AI modeling to develop biomarkers from bone
marrow composition. Secondly, a PCD-CT-based AI risk prediction model will be positioned to
supplant focal invasive approaches that may not offer a comprehensive assessment of the entire
heterogeneity of disease burden.",SUCCESS
Gregory Worrell,Reliable Seizure Prediction Using Physiological Signals and Machine Learning,2025,R01,,,"For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of
their life. Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month),
people with epilepsy take anti-seizure drugs (ASD) daily, suffer ASD related side effects, and spend their lives
dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant
psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily ASD, approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have
seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their
psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting.
There is strong evidence that focal epilepsy is associated with a variable seizure risk that may enable adaptive
therapy targeting periods of high seizure probability. Periods of low seizure probability could require lower
ASD doses, reducing exposure and side effects. We propose that high seizure probability states will respond to
adaptive electrical brain stimulation (aEBS). In addition, patients could alter their activities during periods of
high seizure probability to reduce injury and manage their ASD and activities.
The hypotheses driving this proposal are that 1.) seizures can be prevented (reduced incidence) by targeted
EBS therapy during the pre-ictal state 2.) seizures are not random events, and that brain states associated with
low and high seizure probability can be reliably classified using machine learning methods applied to
physiologic signals and used to adaptively change EBS parameters. 3.) Furthermore, we propose forecasting
can be improved using multi-modal features beyond passive iEEG recordings, including active brain probing
with electrical stimulation (impedance & evoked potentials), core temperature, ECG and serum immunological
markers. Goal: Develop reliable seizure forecasting (>90% sensitivity) with few false positives (<1% time in
warning) and demonstrate modulation of seizure risk and reduction of focal seizures using aEBS.",SUCCESS
ANDREW RULE; JENNIFER ST SAUVER,A population-based study of deep learning derived organ and tissue measures for accelerated aging using repurposed abdominal CT images,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of persons living with reduced physical function and with
aging-related chronic conditions. If we compare chronological age (calendar-based age) with biological age
(changes at the cellular, tissue, organ, and system levels), we can classify persons as aging faster
(accelerated aging) or slower (successful aging) than their peers. Methods have been developed to measure
biological age based on DNA methylation, telomere length, and blood biomarkers. However, such measures
may not accurately reflect organ- and tissue-level changes from aging. A multi-organ/tissue approach is
needed to identify comprehensive age-related structural changes before signs, symptoms, or clinical
diagnoses occur. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) has widespread use in the general population (35%
of adults ages 20-89 years in an 11-year period). Quantitative measures of the organs and tissues on
abdominal CT may predict organ-specific diseases, or in combination, may be used to calculate biological age
and predict the more global outcomes of hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that
deep learning (DL) models applied to abdominal CTs can quantify structural features of the organs and tissues
to identify persons with accelerated aging at high-risk for organ-specific disease, hospitalization, and death.
The Rochester Epidemiology Project record-linkage system provides access to a general population archive of
images for 423,081 abdominal CTs and to comprehensive medical record data among 181,187 adults (ages
20-89 years) between 2010-2020. Our team has already developed and validated DL tools to measure liver,
kidney, aorta, fat, muscle, and bone on abdominal CT images. We will leverage these resources to 1) establish
percentiles of abdominal CT biomarkers from both healthy and general population samples; 2) determine the
risk of organ-specific clinical disease by abdominal CT biomarkers in the general population; and 3) determine
the risk of hospitalization and death associated with abdominal CT measures in the general population. If
successful, application of DL tools to abdominal CT images will enrich the characterization of age-related
health risks without additional testing burden. Subclinical abdominal CT biomarkers may also inform the
biology of aging and early disease, improve disease classification, and provide opportunities for early
intervention.",SUCCESS
Hao Gong; Cynthia McCollough,Diagnostic performance assessment and dose optimization using patient CT images: Application to deep-learning CT reconstruction and denoising technologies,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Half of the man-made radiation exposure to the U.S. population can be attributed to CT. Thus, stakeholders
have invested heavily in the reduction of CT doses. Recently, CT Deep Learning Reconstruction or Denoising
(DLRD) techniques have become available that claim to enable dose reduction in CT, just as CT iterative
reconstruction (IR) claimed before it. Like DLRD, IR showed dramatic apparent increases in image quality by
reducing image noise. Subsequent clinical studies found that true dose reductions capabilities for IR were only
20-25% in soft tissues and organs. Greater dose reductions resulted in compromised signal detectability for
low-contrast lesions (e.g., liver metastases). Now, DLRD algorithms are being used in clinical practice and
appear to yield image quality superior to IR. But again, we are finding that excessive radiation dose reduction
can introduce new artifacts and compromise lesion detectability. Our overall objective is to develop and
validate methods that can quantitatively determine CT protocols that deliver the needed diagnostic
performance at the lowest patient dose for any scanner model or reconstruction algorithm.
 In our first two competitive award periods, we developed robust Channelized Hotelling model observers
(MOs) to quantify diagnostic performance using low contrast objects within a uniform phantom and validated
the work with large scale reader studies for both filtered back projection and IR images. We are deploying
these tools under EB028936 to allow robust dose optimization by CT users. However, there remain challenges.
First, low-contrast phantoms used with most MOs are too simple. Second, highly realistic lesion and noise
insertion tools require use of proprietary projection data and access to manufacturer software tools. Third, MOs
must be extended to work with DLRD methods and be generalizable to any scanner. The proposed work will
use patient image data, obviating the need for projection data, use our developed deep learning (DL)-MOs to
achieve a scalable solution for performance assessment, and be generalizable to any algorithm or scanner.
 The goal of this renewal application is to develop robust DL-MO tools to efficiently predict diagnostic
performance for images created with DLRD methods. We will accomplish this through three specific aims:
1. Develop and validate disease-insertion and low-dose-simulation tools for CT DLRD techniques.
2. Develop and validate DL-MO tools to quantify mean diagnostic performance for DLRD methods.
3. Extend DL-MO methods to estimate performance variations across readers.
 This work is the first to develop and use DL-MOs as accurate and efficient surrogates of human readers to
characterize task-specific performance of DLRD methods in CT using patient images. The resultant performance
assessment engine will facilitate training / testing of DL-based noise reduction algorithms and optimizing CT
protocols and doses. These significant capabilities will ensure that diagnostic performance and the lifesaving
diagnostic information obtained from CT are not compromised in DLRD-processed images.",SUCCESS
Peter Brunner; Kai Miller; Gregory Worrell,An Ecosystem of Technology and Protocols for Adaptive Neuromodulation Research in Humans,2025,U01,,,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Neurological and psychiatric disorders affect millions of people in the United States and worldwide, and produce
a third of all health care costs. Recent research has produced encouraging evidence that adaptive neuromodulation
can induce nervous system plasticity that produces long-lasting improvements in certain neurological disorders
such as stroke. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that the technologies that support these
demonstrations remain painfully inadequate and inaccessible for both research and clinical application: current
non-invasive technologies are typically imprecise; and current invasive technologies, which are more precise, are
currently only available with serious restrictions for human use. Moreover, all of the few existing neuromodulation
platforms for human use require substantial expertise in diverse areas of engineering, physiology, and regulatory
domains that is not available to most groups. This lack of availability of sufﬁciently capable and readily useable
neuromodulation technologies greatly impedes the development, application, and optimization of new adaptive
protocols for improving symptoms of devastating neurological and psychiatric disorders.
 The purpose of the project proposed here is to address this critical issue by developing, validating, and widely
sharing with the community an easy-to-use adaptive neuromodulation ecosystem (comprised of technology and
protocols) that is optimized for the needs of invasive basic and clinical research. We will validate this ecosystem in
a canine model, and disseminate it with appropriate documentation to other scientists and clinicians through three
project-related test sites and three workshops. In accord with this objective, we will:
1. Develop a general-purpose hardware/software neuromodulation platform for invasive neuromodulation research
2. Develop and validate an ecosystem for adaptive neuromodulation research and clinical application
3. Disseminate this ecosystem of technologies and protocols
 Achieving these three aims will create, validate, and disseminate the ﬁrst comprehensive ecosystem that
facilitates the conception, development, and clinical application of invasive adaptive neuromodulation protocols.
We expect that the availability of this ecosystem will greatly increase activities in basic and clinical neuromodulation
research that will lead to new understanding of the neural underpinnings of normal and abnormal function and will
thereby accelerate the development of novel adaptive neuromodulation protocols to improve treatment for many
devastating neurological disorders.",SUCCESS
Aleksandar Denic; Timothy Kline,Artificial Intelligence-Based Methods to Characterize Kidney Macrostructure from Pre- and Post-Nephrectomy Computed Tomography Images,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The prevalence and burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Patients who undergo
radical or partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer resemble the general population with comorbidities, but with
the difference that a majority undergo pre- and post-surgery abdominal imaging. Despite successful surgical
tumor removal, there is a concern for future progressive CKD. Following nephrectomy, the unaffected kidney
undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, and the degree of hypertrophy and kidney function decline depend on
the comorbidity burden and the amount of the removed kidney tissue. With the recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI)--based quantification of kidney volumes from CT scans, there is an opportunity to evaluate
automated imaging biomarkers as prognostic tools. There are also algorithms that quantify the number and
volume of simple parenchymal cysts and many radiomic/texture features. The Co-Principal Investigators in this
program are uniquely equipped for the proposed studies. Dr. Denic has expertise in kidney micro- and macro-
anatomy and advanced biostatistical skills. Dr. Kline has expertise in AI and developing advanced image
processing techniques. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that macrostructural findings on
imaging of the retained (non-operated) kidney after radical or partial nephrectomy are prognostic for
progressive CKD. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the degree of compensatory hypertrophy in the
retained kidney after nephrectomy predicts progressive CKD. Using a recently created deep learning algorithm
we developed, we will quantify the kidney, cortex, and medullary volumes in pre-surgery and follow-up CT
scans (at median 1-year post-surgery). From these volumes, we will calculate the degree of compensatory
changes in kidney volumes and assess their association with baseline comorbidities and microstructural
measures. Finally, we will develop models to predict progressive CKD. In Aim 2, we will first optimize and
finalize training of the model to quantify cysts and their size in CT images and develop postprocessing steps to
separate cortical from medullary cysts. We will then develop models to assess whether the number and size of
cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney in pre-surgery scans, and changes in number and size
of cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney over 1-year post-surgery, can predict progressive
CKD. In Aim 3, we will determine whether novel radiological imaging texture features on pre-surgery scans are
reflective of microstructural measures of nephron size and nephrosclerosis and whether kidney texture
features on follow-up CT scans predict progressive CKD. This research program will be facilitated by Mayo
Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment at all three sites dedicated to improving patient care.
The goal is to develop a tool that can guide clinical decision-making in everyday practice, and that can help
clinicians in improving their care of patients at an individual level by assessing the future risk of CKD.",SUCCESS
Hugo Botha,Automated speech assessment for diagnosis of FTD spectrum disorders,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) are major causes of death and disability in the United
States, with the number of adults with ADRDs projected to reach 13 million by 2050. Among these, the
frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) spectrum disorders are among the most common causes of dementia in
younger individuals (<60y), resulting in high social and economic burden. Diagnosis of FTD is challenging,
typically requiring subspeciality expertise that is not widely available in a timely manner. Many FTD spectrum
disorders manifest in speech, and speech changes can help differentiate FTD subtypes. Prior research
supports the clinical utility of speech-based prediction of FTD presence and subtype. Unfortunately, rigor of
these prior studies is limited for several reasons, including small sample sizes, failure to follow predictive
modeling best practices, use of research grade speech recordings, and lack of prospective validation. We
propose a highly innovative approach to speech-based prediction of FTD that avoids the weaknesses of prior
work. Central to our approach is the insight that FTD may be too rare to use powerful deep learning models,
but the abnormal speech characteristics seen in FTD are also seen in other disorders. Training a model to
recognize these characteristics in FTD does not require limiting the dataset to FTD patients. We plan use this
to our advantage. In Aim 1 we will use a self-administered, web-based speech exam to create a large dataset
of all disorders seen in our speech clinic. Recordings will be made in a standard exam room using mobile
phones or tablets. Our expert speech and language pathologist will annotate the recordings with perceptual
speech characteristics, such as abnormal rate or vocal strain. The large sample size will enable us to use deep
learning for what it excels at – trainable feature extraction optimized for the task at hand. We will follow
predictive modeling best practices, including use of a validation set. In Aim 2 we will apply these trained
models in a large cohort spanning the FTD spectrum and extract the data from the last layer in the network,
just before it makes its prediction. This is a low dimensional representation of the speech signal, but which
contains the information necessary for predicting perceptual characteristics. We will use these representations
to develop a nearest neighbor classifier for FTD. Essentially, the model matches a new case to similar ones in
a labeled set based on the low-dimensional representation and uses the neighborhood to assign a label for the
new case. Finally, in Aim 3 we will combine our self-administered speech exam and the models from Aims 1
and 2 into a single tool and perform a prospective validation study to test performance in a clinical setting. The
predicted increase in ADRDs and lack of access to specialists will necessitate a shift in clinical practice from a
few expert centers to a distributed system of non-expert providers. The digital tool we propose meets this
challenge head on through scalable and easy to use automated speech analysis and prediction of FTD.",SUCCESS
Ann Oberg,Management and Data Coordination Unit for PCDC,2024,U24,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, partially owing to lack of effective
biomarkers and/or screening strategies. The 5-year survival of patients with localized PDAC is 39% compared
to 3% in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease, which indicates that detecting PDAC at early stage
positively impacts survival. A centrally curated/managed multi-institution biospecimen resource containing
prospectively collected, well-annotated biospecimens representing clinically relevant, diverse PDAC screening
populations is desperately needed. The overall goal of the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium (PCDC)
Management and Data Coordinating Center (MDCU) is to facilitate the PCDC’s role in developing and utilizing
high quality, well annotated samples for PDAC biomarker discovery, triage, pre-validation, and validation. The
PCDC consortium is composed of multiple U01 Research Units (RU) and the MDCU, with NCI cooperation and
central biospecimen storage at the NCI Frederick Central Repository. We will leverage our expertise and
knowledge gained during the previous grant cycle to reinforce existing and new PCDC initiatives through
expanded coordination, and strengthening the infrastructure to support management of the PCDC Reference
Sets and Signature Protocols. Our Specific Aims are 1) To provide outstanding and timely administrative
coordination and logistical support for the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium. 2) To strategically plan,
coordinate and implement the development of a well-annotated, uniformly collected and managed central PCDC
biorepository and database. 3) To provide the highest quality biostatistical leadership of PCDC collaborative
experimental design, study conduct, and analysis, and to provide biostatistical consultation to PCDC RUs. The
strengths of the MDCU are the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding of PDAC provided by MDCU
personnel who will innovatively apply time tested infrastructure tools and strategies to consortium management,
and our vast experience in enhancing the scientific needs of PCDC collaborative research. Our multidisciplinary
team is committed to continue its leadership and contribution to the PCDC organization to advance the early
detection of pancreatic cancer.",SUCCESS
Matthew Carlson; Shuai Leng,High-resolution in vivo imaging of inner ear using photon-counting-detector computed tomography and artificial intelligence,2025,R01,,,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Disorders of the inner ear manifest as an array of audiovestibular diseases and constitute a significant public
health burden, affecting millions of individuals and costing billions of dollars each year. As the population ages
worldwide, the disease prevalence is intensifying, necessitating immediate action to address this growing public
health issue. CT imaging of the inner ear is a central component of the diagnostic evaluation of patients
presenting with vestibular symptoms, hearing loss, autophony, and chronic otitis media. As a part of this
evaluation, accurate detection and characterization of potential labyrinthine dehiscence is imperative to
definitively rule in or rule out disease, inform patient counseling, guide shared clinical decision-making, quantify
the risk and potential outcome associated with surgical intervention, and further understand the natural history
of disease. Notably, current in vivo imaging techniques are unable to consistently decipher thin versus truly
dehiscent labyrinthine bone. Further, current CT imaging is not able to fully characterize dehiscence morphology
(shape, size, and surface area). As such, high-quality, high-resolution, artifact-free in vivo imaging is critically
needed for the reliable diagnosis and management of inner ear disorders such as superior semicircular canal
dehiscence syndrome and cholesteatomatous labyrinthine fistula.
To address this unmet clinical need, we propose to develop high-fidelity clinical imaging techniques for the inner
ear using photon counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms. Our team has been at the forefront of PCD-CT development and its clinical translation, and has an
established track record of strong multidisciplinary collaborative innovation in this space. Building upon our
successful prior work, we will harness the power of AI – in synergy with PCD-CT – to reduce image noise,
improve spatial resolution, and reduce radiation dose for CT imaging of the inner ear. We will develop and
validate these techniques with cadavers, and in vivo patient CT exams.
The innovation of our proposal lies in the synergy of PCD-CT and advanced AI algorithms for spatial resolution
improvement, noise and dose reduction, and a cadaver library of normal and labyrinthine thinning and
dehiscence specimens that will enable iterative protocol optimization of ultra-high-spatial-resolution inner ear
imaging. Without the proposed techniques, PCD-CT, while impressive, remains limited by noise, image artifacts,
and radiation dose. Further, under controlled conditions using cadaveric specimens, definitive evidence of the
impact of the developed techniques will be obtained. Successful completion of this proposal will have a significant
impact on patients with inner ear diseases, allowing high-fidelity imaging with improved diagnostic accuracy and
individualized patient management. In addition, the technical innovations for noise reduction, super-resolution,
and dose reduction developed in the proposal will benefit inner ear imaging tasks beyond dehiscence, including
direct visualization of the interscalar cochlear partition, and can be readily applied to the middle ear.",SUCCESS
Ananth Madhuranthakam,Next-Generation Whole-Body MRI for Detection and Assessment of Therapy Response in Bone Lesions,2025,R01,,,"Project Summary
 Bone lesions from solid tumors such as breast, prostate, or kidney cancers, tumors originating in the bone
marrow such as multiple myeloma (MM), or other non-malignant musculoskeletal pathologies can occur
anywhere in the skeleton. These bone lesions cause pain and spinal cord compressions, leading to pathologic
fractures and paralysis, thereby diminishing the patient's quality of life. Current therapies rely on diagnosing
these bone lesions by whole-body X-ray or bone scans, which only identify them at advanced stages. While
whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) is recommended for pretreatment assessment (e.g., in
MM), MRI is often limited to spine and pelvic regions in practice to minimize patient discomfort, compromised
image quality from geometric distortion, and high costs due to prolonged acquisition times. To address this
unmet clinical need, we developed a novel WBMRI technique: `Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for
Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors' (DETECT), for improved lesion visualization by simultaneously separating
the confounding signals of fat and fluid. Compared to WBMRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), single-
shot DETECT increased lesion detection (>40%) in considerably shorter scan times (<10 min) and without
image distortions. This method also improved robustness to motion in the thoracic and abdomen regions,
however, it suffers from image blurring due to T2-decay particularly in spine and extremities, limiting the
diagnostic performance. In the current proposal, we will address these limitations by developing the next-
generation WBMRI-DETECT using an efficient combination of single-shot and multi-shot acquisitions. DETECT
also generates fat signal for quantitative fat fraction (FF) maps that can be used as a prognostic biomarker in
MM, since tumor cells replace fat, a major constituent of bone marrow. This method also led us to develop a
DETECT-based DWI technique for accurate measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The specific
aims are: 1) To develop an integrated WBMRI using single-shot and multi-shot DETECT, along with
quantitative FF maps; 2) To develop a DETECT-based DWI with accurate ADC measurements; and 3) To
evaluate the integrated WBMRI, including DETECT-DWI and contrast-enhanced perfusion, for efficient bone
lesion detection and therapy response assessment. We will use bone lesions in MM as the proof-of-concept
disease to achieve these project goals. The successful outcome of this project will be an efficient WBMRI
protocol with accurate FF and ADC measures as imaging biomarkers, validated in detection and measuring
therapy response in MM patients. This WBMRI in combination with contrast-enhanced MRI including perfusion,
will be an excellent cost-effective and practical approach (<45 minutes of table time) for widespread use in
clinical practices across the world. This will benefit MM patients and patients suffering from other bone lesions,
including pediatric patients during long follow-ups, without the drawbacks of PET/CT. This will provide relevant
clinical information for treatment decisions to positively impact patients' quality of life and overall survival.",SUCCESS
Andrea Cheville,"Project HoPe: Achieving Home Discharge for institutionally-bound Patients with PROMs, AI, and the EHR",2025,R01,,,"Unnecessary discharges from a hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) are costly and may accelerate
patients’ functional losses and requirement for long-term institutionalization. Patients with Alzheimer's Disease
and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and other types of cognitive impairment are uniquely
disadvantaged by this status quo in that they are twice as likely to be hospitalized, four times more likely to be
discharged to SNFs with less than 50% returning to their homes. This situation can be addressed as it is the
product of a typically rushed discharge planning process with inadequate time to discover, much less address,
a patient’s barriers to home discharge. Recent reports suggest that as many as a third of patients dismissed to
SNFs, including those with AD/ADRD, could return directly home if their post-acute care (PAC) needs and
barriers were anticipated and addressed. Several key deficits prevent broad realization of a patients’ potential to
discharge directly home, or their Home PAC Potential (HoPe). These include a limited ability to: 1) quantify
factors that determine PAC needs, 2) identify and address remediable barriers to home discharge, and 3)
mobilize stakeholders for advancement of individualized discharge plans. Collectively, these deficits prevent
the timely initiation of acute care services that can realize a patient’s potential for home discharge, with PAC as
necessary. Rehabilitation-focused, hospital-Home Healthcare Agency (HHA) partnerships have established that
interdisciplinary care plans enacted early in a hospital stay with patient and caregiver involvement increase the
likelihood of a patient’s return home. Our team developed an Epic electronic health record (EHR)-based
discharge planning system that triangulates EHR, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and social determinants
of health data to identify HoPe barriers and direct needs-matched rehabilitation service delivery. A pilot of the
system among 358 patients increased the home discharge rate by over 25% and revealed high user
acceptability. However, the pilot also identified the need to improve addressing of cognitive impairments,
targeting of high-yield HoPe barriers, and engagement of non-clinical stakeholders. We propose to address
these limitations by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Develop a low-burden computerized adaptive test PRO to
assess the domains of functional cognition relevant to a safe home discharge; 2) Develop a machine learning
algorithm to prioritize actionable HoPe barriers and estimate the degree of change needed for home discharge;
and 3) Apply user-centered design principles to refine the EHR discharge planning system for optimal usability
and enhanced EHR portal patient, caregiver, and HHA staff access. Our goal is to both integrate and pilot
these deliverables in a mature and optimally usable EHR discharge planning system, and to evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of its implementation. We anticipate that the system will be scalable, and amenable
to inter-institution transfer for testing in a multi-site pragmatic trial.",SUCCESS

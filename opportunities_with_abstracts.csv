A U24 core facility is an excellent target.","PROJECT SUMMARY
Mayo Clinic Chemical Center (MCC) is funded to perform targeted metabolites and exosome cargo
measurements in samples collected in the Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC.
As advised by the steering committee, we have expended a substantial amount of time developing an innovative
methodology to isolate plasma exosomes and demonstrated reproducibility in multiple experiments, at different
time points and by different laboratories. We propose exosome-based proteome and miRNA analysis in a limited
number of samples. Based on power calculations, we estimated that the proposed number of samples will detect
significant changes in exosome proteome and miRNA responses to aerobic and resistance exercise training. We
will also test a hypothesis that proteome and miRNA release after acute exercise will be different in people who
are highly active in comparison with sedentary people, because the prior exercise training accretes specific
exercise-induced proteins in tissues that will be released during and immediately after both modes of exercise.
These measurements will be done in 140 sedentary people and 110 highly active people and will likely offer
unique new information. In addition, 55 sedentary people will be evaluated at baseline and following 3 months
each of aerobic and resistance training with 30 sedentary controls studied after a 3-month control period.
Secondly, in alignment with metabolomic measurements done at other centers, we will perform measurement of
two quantitative targeted metabolites-amino metabolites and organic acids in plasma and skeletal muscle. These
targeted metabolites are chosen based on their biological relevance to exercise training, and the quantitative
and reproducible data anticipated from our assays would complement large scale metabolites measured in other
Chemical Centers. The targeted metabolome measurement will also offer an opportunity to potentially
understand the biochemical pathways involved in exercise benefits. We chose muscle and plasma
measurements of organic acids representing the substrates of the citric acid flux pathway and amino metabolites
which, based on many preliminary studies, are shown to sensitively respond to exercise with distinct responses
to aerobic and resistance exercise.
Both targeted metabolites in muscle and plasma as well as exosome-based measurements of proteome and
miRNA are anticipated to reveal novel information on how specific exercise programs may benefit physiological
functions. We anticipate that the results from our study in combination with the ongoing multiple omic
measurements in all chemical centers will likely unravel deeper insights on how exercise benefits multiple
organs. Our objective is to advance the translational potential of exosome cargo by administering biological
molecules offering exercise benefits via small vesicles like exosomes to multiple organs in the body. The
metabolites, especially targeted metabolites, are likely biomarkers to monitor responses to the administered
vesicles carrying potentially beneficial molecules.",SUCCESS

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 30 million Americans and incur healthcare cost of $30.9
billion every year. There is an urgent need of a safe and noninvasive clinical tool for accurate staging of CKD,
which is essential for its management. The importance of renal parenchyma perfusion and vasculature
morphology for CKD characterization has been documented by many studies, but is not used clinically due to
lack of translatable imaging solutions. In this project, we will use a novel super-resolution ultrasound imaging
(SRUI) technology, which can resolve 50-micron renal cortex microvessels and measure their blood flow speed
in human, to quantify cortex microvessel morphology and perfusion for accurate CKD characterization.
Aim 1: Technical development. New acquisition and processing methods will be developed to enhance
performance of SRUI through phantom and patient experiments. Novel quantitative parameters of SRUI for
renal cortex will be developed, which includes vessel density, diameter, and tortuosity, as well as mean blood
flow velocity, micro- Resistive Index of arterioles and venules, and perfusion index.
Aim 2: Animal validations. We will study 7 normal pigs and 14 CKD pigs with renal artery stenosis (RAS) to
validate SRUI measurements using independent measurements obtained through contrast enhanced CT,
micro-CT, and histology.
Aim 3: Clinical study. We will study 50 healthy volunteers to establish the normal range of SRUI parameters
and study 116 CKD patients with clinically indicated renal biopsy to investigate the efficacy of SRUI for CKD
staging, using biopsy histology as the reference standard. Statistical difference between CKD patients and
healthy controls and differences across CKD stages defined by histology will be evaluated. The association of
each ultrasound parameter with histology CKD score will be assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression and ROC analyses (receiver operating characteristic) analyses will be performed to assess the
performance of SRUI, conventional ultrasound (renal length, cortex thickness, Doppler renal resistive index,
and shear wave elastography), and clinical parameters (eGFR and proteinuria) for distinguishing histology
CKD stages. A subset (N=45) of patients will be scanned by two sonographers randomly selected from a pool
of five sonographers. Intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to evaluate the inter-sonographer
agreement. The inter-sonographer variance will be calculated to estimate the minimum detectable difference
for longitudinal follow-ups.
Successful completion of this project will result in a safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and accessible ultrasound
technology for accurate characterization of chronic kidney disease to guide treatment decision making.",SUCCESS

patients’ functional losses and requirement for long-term institutionalization. Patients with Alzheimer's Disease
and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and other types of cognitive impairment are uniquely
disadvantaged by this status quo in that they are twice as likely to be hospitalized, four times more likely to be
discharged to SNFs with less than 50% returning to their homes. This situation can be addressed as it is the
product of a typically rushed discharge planning process with inadequate time to discover, much less address,
a patient’s barriers to home discharge. Recent reports suggest that as many as a third of patients dismissed to
SNFs, including those with AD/ADRD, could return directly home if their post-acute care (PAC) needs and
barriers were anticipated and addressed. Several key deficits prevent broad realization of a patients’ potential to
discharge directly home, or their Home PAC Potential (HoPe). These include a limited ability to: 1) quantify
factors that determine PAC needs, 2) identify and address remediable barriers to home discharge, and 3)
mobilize stakeholders for advancement of individualized discharge plans. Collectively, these deficits prevent
the timely initiation of acute care services that can realize a patient’s potential for home discharge, with PAC as
necessary. Rehabilitation-focused, hospital-Home Healthcare Agency (HHA) partnerships have established that
interdisciplinary care plans enacted early in a hospital stay with patient and caregiver involvement increase the
likelihood of a patient’s return home. Our team developed an Epic electronic health record (EHR)-based
discharge planning system that triangulates EHR, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and social determinants
of health data to identify HoPe barriers and direct needs-matched rehabilitation service delivery. A pilot of the
system among 358 patients increased the home discharge rate by over 25% and revealed high user
acceptability. However, the pilot also identified the need to improve addressing of cognitive impairments,
targeting of high-yield HoPe barriers, and engagement of non-clinical stakeholders. We propose to address
these limitations by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Develop a low-burden computerized adaptive test PRO to
assess the domains of functional cognition relevant to a safe home discharge; 2) Develop a machine learning
algorithm to prioritize actionable HoPe barriers and estimate the degree of change needed for home discharge;
and 3) Apply user-centered design principles to refine the EHR discharge planning system for optimal usability
and enhanced EHR portal patient, caregiver, and HHA staff access. Our goal is to both integrate and pilot
these deliverables in a mature and optimally usable EHR discharge planning system, and to evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of its implementation. We anticipate that the system will be scalable, and amenable
to inter-institution transfer for testing in a multi-site pragmatic trial.",SUCCESS

Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement is the gold standard to evaluate PHTN but not readily available in routine clinical settings due to its invasiveness and requirement of adequate operator skill and experience. Thus, an urgent need for a safe, reliable, operator-independent noninvasive method exists for diagnosing and monitoring PHTN to allow early targeted interventions. Biological soft tissues usually have a biphasic architecture, including a solid matrix (cells, extracellular matrix) saturated with fluid (interstitial fluid and blood). MR elastography (MRE) can quantitatively assess multiple tissue mechanical properties. Within them, liver stiffness, which comprises solid stress and fluid pressure, is widely used clinically to assess hepatic fibrosis as a liver biopsy alternative. 
Our prior studies show that MRE-assessed viscoelasticity can distinguish solid-related fibrosis and fluid-related inflammation in early-stage CLD. Other hepatosplenic MRE parameters (compressibility and nonlinearity) are promising biomarkers for hemodynamics-associated fluid pressure but require systematic evaluation. 
The overall goal of this work is to develop an advanced multiparametric 3D vector MRE (3DV MRE) technique of the liver and spleen for fully characterizing PHTN in advanced CLD. 
• In Aim 1, a dual-frequency, self-navigating, and hybrid radial-Cartesian 3DV MRE method will be developed for characterizing multiple mechanical properties in both small animals and human subjects. We will develop a model-based iterative reconstruction and a 3D neural network inversion to calculate viscoelasticity, compressibility, and nonlinearity in the liver and spleen from the hybrid 3DV MRE data. 
• In Aim 2, we will use 3DV MRE imaging on three PHTN rat models (diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (N=22), cirrhosis-induced PHTN after bile duct ligation surgery (N=22), and congestion-induced PHTN after partial inferior vena cava ligation surgery (N=22)). Technical integrity, scientific rigor, and diagnostic accuracy will be assessed by comparing multiple imaging biomarkers with in vivo interstitial fluid and portal pressure measurements, ex vivo dynamic mechanical analysis testing results, and histologic features. 
• Before the clinical translation, we will evaluate the repeatability of MRE biomarkers in 5 controls and 5 clinical patients using a test-retest strategy. Finally, a pilot clinical study in 10 controls and 50 clinical patients with endoscopy or HVPG will rigorously cross-validate the diagnostic accuracy of the PHTN predictors. 
Advanced 3DV MRE development enables other investigators and us to explore this promising technology for many other etiologies related to fluid pressure. This project’s success will also provide a valuable noninvasive assessment tool for emerging therapeutic interventions.",SUCCESS

Osteoporotic fractures threaten the health, independence, and survival of millions of people nationwide. An
estimated 40% of women and 30% of men will suffer a hip, spine, or wrist fracture in their lifetime. Two million
Americans experience a fracture annually, resulting in more than 430,000 hospital admissions, 2.5 million
medical office visits, and 180,000 nursing home admissions. Due in part to an aging population, the cost of
osteoporotic fracture-related care will exceed $25 billion by 2025. This suffering and cost is preventable. Large
randomized controlled trials (RCT) have demonstrated the substantial benefit of osteoporosis drug therapies
(ODT) in reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet, fewer than 50-80% of patients at risk of fracture will
receive ODT and half will discontinue them prematurely. Underuse of, and poor adherence to, ODTs stems in
part from the lack of evidence about the effectiveness and safety long-term use of anti-resorptive ODT (i.e.,
bisphosphonates and denosumab), particularly with respect to rare side effects such as atypical femur fracture
(AFF) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). While interruption of long-term ODT (‘drug holiday’) and use of
sequential therapies (i.e., anabolic ODT followed by anti-resorptive ODT) have been proposed as ways to limit
risks of AFF and ONJ, it remains unknown whether these strategies actually reduce risk of harm without
compromising ODT effectiveness with respect to fracture prevention. We will address these knowledge gaps by
emulating a series of target RCTs examining the comparative effectiveness and safety of ODT regimens with
respect to fragility fractures (primary outcome), AFF, ONJ, and other safety endpoints. We will use claims and
electronic health record data from OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a dataset of privately-insured and Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries, linked to a 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims, to allow for an
unprecedented evaluation of ODT over time and across populations, geographies, health systems, and health
plans. We will emulate the following target RCTs (eRCTs): Aim 1) eRCT 1 comparing ≤3 years vs. >3 years non-
interrupted anti-resorptive therapy. Aim 2) eRCT 2 comparing non-interrupted long-term biphosphonate ODT
(>3 years) vs. short-term (≤3 years) ODT followed by either brief (≤3 years) or prolonged (>3 years) drug holiday.
Aim 3) eRCT 3 comparing sequential therapy with anabolic ODT followed by >3 years bisphosphonate vs.
denosumab treatment. Within each eRCT, we will assess for heterogeneity of treatment effects as a function of
gender and risk profile (e.g. steroid use, etc). Finally, to address the gaps in translation of evidence to patient
care decisions, Aim 4 will update and field test an effective but outdated shared decision-making tool
(Osteoporosis Choice) with data produced by Aims 1-3. At the conclusion of this work, we will generate both the
evidence to inform high quality osteoporosis care and a ready-to-use shared decision-making tool to support the
implementation of this evidence into practice to improve the health of patients with osteoporosis.",SUCCESS

MRI for Detection and Assessment"" is a classic computational image analysis problem.","Project Summary
 Bone lesions from solid tumors such as breast, prostate, or kidney cancers, tumors originating in the bone
marrow such as multiple myeloma (MM), or other non-malignant musculoskeletal pathologies can occur
anywhere in the skeleton. These bone lesions cause pain and spinal cord compressions, leading to pathologic
fractures and paralysis, thereby diminishing the patient's quality of life. Current therapies rely on diagnosing
these bone lesions by whole-body X-ray or bone scans, which only identify them at advanced stages. While
whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) is recommended for pretreatment assessment (e.g., in
MM), MRI is often limited to spine and pelvic regions in practice to minimize patient discomfort, compromised
image quality from geometric distortion, and high costs due to prolonged acquisition times. To address this
unmet clinical need, we developed a novel WBMRI technique: `Dual-Echo T2-weighted acquisition for
Enhanced Conspicuity of Tumors' (DETECT), for improved lesion visualization by simultaneously separating
the confounding signals of fat and fluid. Compared to WBMRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), single-
shot DETECT increased lesion detection (>40%) in considerably shorter scan times (<10 min) and without
image distortions. This method also improved robustness to motion in the thoracic and abdomen regions,
however, it suffers from image blurring due to T2-decay particularly in spine and extremities, limiting the
diagnostic performance. In the current proposal, we will address these limitations by developing the next-
generation WBMRI-DETECT using an efficient combination of single-shot and multi-shot acquisitions. DETECT
also generates fat signal for quantitative fat fraction (FF) maps that can be used as a prognostic biomarker in
MM, since tumor cells replace fat, a major constituent of bone marrow. This method also led us to develop a
DETECT-based DWI technique for accurate measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The specific
aims are: 1) To develop an integrated WBMRI using single-shot and multi-shot DETECT, along with
quantitative FF maps; 2) To develop a DETECT-based DWI with accurate ADC measurements; and 3) To
evaluate the integrated WBMRI, including DETECT-DWI and contrast-enhanced perfusion, for efficient bone
lesion detection and therapy response assessment. We will use bone lesions in MM as the proof-of-concept
disease to achieve these project goals. The successful outcome of this project will be an efficient WBMRI
protocol with accurate FF and ADC measures as imaging biomarkers, validated in detection and measuring
therapy response in MM patients. This WBMRI in combination with contrast-enhanced MRI including perfusion,
will be an excellent cost-effective and practical approach (<45 minutes of table time) for widespread use in
clinical practices across the world. This will benefit MM patients and patients suffering from other bone lesions,
including pediatric patients during long follow-ups, without the drawbacks of PET/CT. This will provide relevant
clinical information for treatment decisions to positively impact patients' quality of life and overall survival.",SUCCESS

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) are major causes of death and disability in the United
States, with the number of adults with ADRDs projected to reach 13 million by 2050. Among these, the
frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) spectrum disorders are among the most common causes of dementia in
younger individuals (<60y), resulting in high social and economic burden. Diagnosis of FTD is challenging,
typically requiring subspeciality expertise that is not widely available in a timely manner. Many FTD spectrum
disorders manifest in speech, and speech changes can help differentiate FTD subtypes. Prior research
supports the clinical utility of speech-based prediction of FTD presence and subtype. Unfortunately, rigor of
these prior studies is limited for several reasons, including small sample sizes, failure to follow predictive
modeling best practices, use of research grade speech recordings, and lack of prospective validation. We
propose a highly innovative approach to speech-based prediction of FTD that avoids the weaknesses of prior
work. Central to our approach is the insight that FTD may be too rare to use powerful deep learning models,
but the abnormal speech characteristics seen in FTD are also seen in other disorders. Training a model to
recognize these characteristics in FTD does not require limiting the dataset to FTD patients. We plan use this
to our advantage. In Aim 1 we will use a self-administered, web-based speech exam to create a large dataset
of all disorders seen in our speech clinic. Recordings will be made in a standard exam room using mobile
phones or tablets. Our expert speech and language pathologist will annotate the recordings with perceptual
speech characteristics, such as abnormal rate or vocal strain. The large sample size will enable us to use deep
learning for what it excels at – trainable feature extraction optimized for the task at hand. We will follow
predictive modeling best practices, including use of a validation set. In Aim 2 we will apply these trained
models in a large cohort spanning the FTD spectrum and extract the data from the last layer in the network,
just before it makes its prediction. This is a low dimensional representation of the speech signal, but which
contains the information necessary for predicting perceptual characteristics. We will use these representations
to develop a nearest neighbor classifier for FTD. Essentially, the model matches a new case to similar ones in
a labeled set based on the low-dimensional representation and uses the neighborhood to assign a label for the
new case. Finally, in Aim 3 we will combine our self-administered speech exam and the models from Aims 1
and 2 into a single tool and perform a prospective validation study to test performance in a clinical setting. The
predicted increase in ADRDs and lack of access to specialists will necessitate a shift in clinical practice from a
few expert centers to a distributed system of non-expert providers. The digital tool we propose meets this
challenge head on through scalable and easy to use automated speech analysis and prediction of FTD.",SUCCESS

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a devastating and prevalent cancer of the liver with high rates of mortality.
Major risk factors include chronic viral infection (hepatitis B or C), fatty liver disease, alcohol use, and exposure
to environmental toxins. An independent risk factor is a family history of HCC, which raises the risk by more than
2.5-fold. However, despite evidence of familial risk, the inherited component remains unknown. It also remains
unexplored whether inherited gene variants play a pathogenic role in HCC development, or whether they could
be used to guide treatment with targeted therapies. We have pioneered an investigation into inherited (i.e.
germline) genetic factors associated with HCC. We have completed a pilot analysis of 217 patients with HCC
prospectively enrolled from our medical center for clinical-grade multigene panel genetic testing. We have
captured details about their personal and family cancer history, risk factors, and outcomes. In our pilot analysis,
we found a surprisingly high rate of pathogenic germline variants in cancer-associated genes in patients with
HCC, including numerous pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in genes required for homologous repair,
DNA damage response (HR-DDR). We hypothesize that inherited loss-of-function variants in specific genes are
enriched in HCC, and that carriers can be treated with targeted therapies. In Aim 1, we will conduct genetic
association studies that are powered to detect clinically meaningful germline variants linked to HCC, and we will
examine predictors of hereditary cancer syndromes in HCC including age of onset and family history of cancer.
In Aim 2, we will explore the mechanism of HCC arising from defects in HR-DDR genes, and determine the
implications for targeted therapies. These innovative studies of the hereditary genetics of HCC have the potential
to personalize therapies for the subset of patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. We have assembled a
team of experts in HCC, hereditary genetics, and animal models to complete this investigation. This study has

The identification of cancer metastases to the bony vertebral column obligates the treating clinician to make a
surgical decision. Current spinal stability decision-making is empirical, qualitative, and can be inaccurate. The
consequences of that decision for the patient, however, are significant. If the spine is deemed at risk for
fracture, then the patient will undergo a major spinal operation. Conversely, the patient whose spine is deemed
stable risks fracture and possible paralysis if the analysis was incorrect. This research program addresses both
the stability decision and the nature of the treatment. In this renewal application, we will continue our efforts to
develop non-invasive, quantitative, and reliable methods to predict the fracture risk of vertebrae with metastatic
cancer under physiologically relevant loading conditions, and to optimize minimally invasive techniques using
novel biomaterials to reconstitute the load bearing capacity of an affected vertebra. In Aim 1, we propose a
novel injectable polymer network that can be self-crosslinked via catalyst-free click chemistry into “click”
organic-inorganic nanohybrid (click-ON) bone cement. Compared to our previous injectable system, the novel
cement has improved biocompatibility, injectability, and crosslinking efficiency. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
efficacy of the optimized click-ON bone cement to both prevent impending fractures and treat existing fractures
in cadaveric models using the clinical vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures, respectively (Aim 2a). Intact
lumbar spines (L1-S1), spines with simulated lytic defects, and spines with biomaterial augmentation will be
tested under accurate and biomimetic loading conditions using a novel robotic testing system. Our previously
developed quantitative computerized tomography based finite element analysis (QCT/FEA) models will be
expanded to include both kinematic motion evaluation and fracture risk prediction under physiological loading
and boundary conditions and validated using the experimental results (Aim 2b). In Aim 3, We will develop a
phantom-less calibration technique to account for the effects of QCT protocols on QCT/FEA results (Aim 3a).
Using the powerful AnalyzeMD platform, we will implement an automated process to further advance the FEA
technique for time efficiency and reproducibility (Aim 3b). We will apply the comprehensive QCT/FEA models
in a retrospective cohort of spine metastasis patients and assess the virtual reconstruction using the click-ON
bone cement as a first step towards clinical translation. The QCT/FEA technique developed in this work takes
into consideration both the quality and quantity of bone and the degeneration status of the intervertebral discs.
This technique allows the clinician to counsel her/his patient regarding activities of daily living that can be
performed with a low risk of spinal fracture. Our future plans are to expand the clinical implementation of the
spinal FEA analysis at Mayo Clinic. We will add FEA evaluation results in our discussion with the patients
regarding our recommendations for their care. We will study the outcome results of those recommendations,
adjust the decision parameters as necessary, and then extend the analysis to additional institutions.",SUCCESS

lead to new interventions for kidney disease. Automated morphometry with deep learning (DL) networks may
be able to rapidly measure nephrosclerosis, nephron number, and nephron size. Novel morphometry of
structures impacted by glomerular hyperfiltration (podocyte and parietal epithelial cell (PEC) density,
Bowman’s space, and the diameter of proximal and distal tubule) and of microvasculature are needed to better
understand the pathophysiology of early disease. Proteomic analysis of specific microstructures that differ
between kidneys that do versus do not develop CKD outcomes has the potential to identify prognostic or even
pathogenic proteins for early kidney disease. The multi-discipline multi-site Aging Kidney Anatomy study has
unique resources for the study of microstructure in “normal” kidneys. This includes data and specimens on

The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is entering a new era where increasing numbers of novel treatments
targeting the biological underpinnings of AD will be available within the foreseeable future. If we fail to identify
cognitive impairment due to AD early, we will miss an important treatment window. There is a critical need for
easily accessible, scalable, and sensitive cognitive tools that can aid early detection and monitoring of
cognitive impairment and thereby allow earlier intervention to mitigate further decline. High quality, brief
cognitive assessment tools that can be deployed remotely or via self-administration in clinic settings represent
one key component of the future of AD research and clinical practice. These tools will help enrich clinical trials
and aid triage decisions to inform specialty clinic referrals and initiation of treatment in clinics, ideally in
conjunction with plasma biomarkers to address both clinical symptoms and underlying biology. Additional
validation of novel remote cognitive assessment tools is needed. Mayo Test Development through Rapid
Iteration, Validation and Expansion (Mayo Test Drive, MTD) is a cognitive testing platform developed for self-
administered digital cognitive assessment. MTD addresses remote assessment needs and is a multi-device
(smartphone, tablet, PC), flexible and easily accessible platform, with subtests that provide more in-depth
assessment of targeted cognitive domains relative to typical screening tests. The MTD brief cognitive
screening battery takes 15-20 minutes and includes 2 subtests: (1) the Stricker Learning Span (SLS), a novel
computer adaptive word list memory test (learning and delay trials) and (2) Symbols Test, an open-source
measure of visual matching and processing speed/executive function; these are combined into a screening
battery composite (MTD-SBC). The overall goal of this R01 is to establish the validity of the MTD-SBC and the
SLS for several specific contexts of use. Specific aims are to (1) determine cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy
of MTD for clinically defined and PET biomarker-defined groups, (2) demonstrate sensitivity of MTD to amyloid-
related cognitive decline over 30 months, (3) determine utility of MTD for detecting clinical progression over 45
months, and (4) determine whether MTD performance is associated with plasma biomarkers to a similar
degree as in-person neuropsychological measures. Most participants will be recruited from the Mayo Clinic
Study of Aging, with additional recruitment from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN and
Jacksonville, FL) and the Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Center - Mayo Clinic Study of
Aging at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, MS (N=2,300 across cohorts, predominantly
remote administration). By increasing the representation of diverse participants and the range of social and
structural determinants of health (SSDoH) with the Jackson, MS and Jacksonville, FL cohorts, we will be able

While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in men and women, substantial sex differences
exist in disease prevalence and prognosis. A key impact of menopause is risk of future CVD. Post-menopausal
women are twice as likely to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure
hospitalization rates disproportionately increase in women as they age. We hypothesize that a key contributor to
this trend are hormonal changes during menopausal transition which accelerate myocardial stiffening. The impact
of menopausal transition on myocardial stiffness is unknown. If understood, new disease prevention and
therapy monitory strategies with significant potential for long-term benefits could be investigated.
Elevated myocardial stiffness, a precursor of several CVDs, can go undetected prior to heart failure symptoms from
diastolic dysfunction because left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is preserved, and absolute LV chamber stiffness
is not routinely measured. Current quantitative stiffness measurements require ex vivo mechanical testing or
invasive pressure-volume measurements, hampering their adoption as practical clinical biomarkers.
This proposal’s objective are to 1) establish a baseline for normal stiffness values during natural aging through
menopausal transition and 2) identify sex as a biological variable. To accomplish these goals, we will develop a free
breathing 3D non-invasive cardiac magnetic resonance elastography (cMRE) technique to measure myocardial
stiffness. The technological advances in this study will make myocardial stiffness imaging in heart failure patients
with dyspnea more reliably, regional, and enable quantitative cross-sectional and longitudinal monitoring of
myocardial stiffness. Our preliminary data shows that LV myocardial stiffness increases significantly in healthy
women, but not men, after the age of 50, which corresponds to the average age of menopausal transition. If cMRE
can be used to detect elevated myocardial stiffening during menopausal transition and prior to the development of
diastolic disfunction, the monitoring of current and new preventive interventions prior to heart failure symptoms will
be made possible. To accomplish these objectives, we will:
• Develop a 3D, free-breathing cMRE application.
• Retrospectively bin cMRE data for multiple 3D MRE volumes that vary during the cardiac cycle.
• Validate cMRE in static and pulsatile realistic cardiac phantoms.
• Identify a clinical and technically feasible acquisition durations in a normal volunteer pilot study.
• Evaluate the influence of natural aging, sex, and menopausal transition on myocardial stiffness.
The natural evolution of myocardial stiffness in natural aging, in relation to sex-biases, and throughout menopausal
transition will be evaluated using a newly developed and implemented free breathing non-invasive quantitative
cMRE approach, which may have significant implications for the prevention of heart failure.",SUCCESS

progressive renal insufficiency and often kidney failure and accounts for ~5% of US kidney transplant
and dialysis patients. ADPKD is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous with seven genes now
associated with this disease, including the major loci, PKD1 and PKD2. Large patient populations
collected at Mayo Clinic have been central to new gene identification, and newly available populations of
normal individuals with whole exome sequencing and clinical data are providing insight into the
penetrance of ADPKD genes and alleles. In Aim 1, using these populations we will determine the extent
to which phenotypes within the ADPKD spectrum are dictated by novel genes, and explore the
penetrance of known alleles. Allelic diversity and complexity, especially for PKD1, has made diagnostics
for this disorder complex, with many patients not obtaining a definite genetic diagnosis following testing
using the existing variant evaluation guidelines; only variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are defined.
Functional, cellular assays and whole animal systems can help to determine pathogenicity and
penetrance of variants classified as VUS. In Aim 2 we will employ cellular and in vivo studies to determine
the mechanism(s) of disease causation for PKD1 and PKD2 pathogenic variants. These studies will
improve diagnostics and generate models that together will unravel the pathogenic mechanism of many
nontruncating variants and allow the associated disease to be modeled. Insights into the
pathomechanism of disease can also highlight new treatment options that are proximal to the primary
genetic defect, strategies that have been successful exploited for other monogenic disorders. Two variant
types in particular, missense changes that result in folding and trafficking problems, and nonsense
variants are common causes of disease in PKD1 and PKD2. In Aim 3 we will, explore allele-based
treatment options for ADPKD. Specifically, chaperone treatments will be tested for missense variants
where a folding/trafficking defect is the mutational mechanism, and the value of readthrough drugs for a
variety of PKD1 and PKD2 nonsense variants will be tested, both with cellular assays and in vivo systems.
Treatment options for ADPKD also depend on better understanding the mutational mechanism at the
level of the cyst; there has long been controversy in ADPKD about the importance and timing of somatic
second hits for cyst initiation and/or expansion. In Aim 4 we will investigate the role of somatic changes
in cyst initiation and development using single cell DNA sequencing methods. Overall, our proposal will
result in better understand the pathomechanisms associated with the genetic complexity of ADPKD, with

The interaction between microbes and the immune system plays a key role in human health. Microbes can help
train and develop major components of the host’s innate and adaptive immunity, while the immune system
orchestrates the host-microbe symbiosis. Many studies use animal models, population level 16S rRNA gene and
metagenomic sequencing to gain evidence on microbe-immune correlation, however, the underlying mechanism
is relatively undefined due to the complexity of this ecosystem and the limitations of the available tools. The
overarching goal of my research program is to understand how the biological functions of the microbial and cells
of the innate immune system co-evolve. Dissecting the crosstalk between the microbial and immune cells is
challenging and requires more sophisticated methods. My overall goal is to develop tools to understand, for
example, how can microbial cells influence the innate immune system even if their number is few? How do the
microbes and the immune system co-evolve according to the constantly changing strategies of the other? To
probe these questions, I propose to use a bottom-up approach that starts a single microbial and immune cell
and builds up complexity. Over the past 5 years, I developed a microfluidic platform and methods for single cell
whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, suitable for the sequencing of both bacterial and human cells.
This platform led to the discovery of preferential genetic alterations in microbes that adapted to extreme living
conditions, and that the gene expression profile in individual microbial cells is distinct. During the next 5 years, I
plan to modify and optimize this platform to investigate the bi-directional relationship between the microbial and
immune cells. This work will be centered on dendritic cells and Staphylococcus aureus as an exemplary study,
and then incorporate other cell types and environmental factors. Briefly, I plan to study how a single microbial
cell can be perceived as a group to regulate the signaling pathways of a single immune cell through analyzing
their transcriptional profiles. Central to this work is to integrate additional components into the platform to enable
the co-culture of a single microbial and immune cell, activate and monitoring their signaling, and investigate the
signaling pathways through whole transcriptome sequencing. This work will ultimately help map different immune
cell phenotypes and their responses to various microbes, which will lead to the better understanding of the
heterogenous and dynamic immune responses. In the long run, this research program will accelerate the study
of how microbiome and the immune system are cross-regulated in more complex settings. Besides, these
fundamental processes involve general biology principles at single cell transcriptional levels and are applicable
to diverse host cells, lending broader significance to the proposed work.",SUCCESS

Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in the U.S. Screening reduces mortality from several of the most
common (colorectal, breast, uterine cervix, and lung) cancers but most cancer types, accounting for 70% of
cancer deaths, are not screened due to limitations in technology and low positive predictive value, driven by
low incidence of each individual cancer type. It has been argued that multi-cancer detection tests might
address this critical long-term gap in population health. To avoid false-positive results, commercial multi-cancer
test developers train performance on high specificity goals at the penalty of low sensitivity for early-stage
cancers, and current tests may more or less accurate depending on the organ/type of cancer. This application
proposes to use unique sample archives to address key scientific questions. Specifically, there are relatively
limited assessments of 1) how well and at what interval multi-cancer test predict the development of clinical
cancer (indolent vs lethal) among asymptomatic individuals (prediagnostic performance study); 2) how to
evaluate or validate promising liquid biopsy-based biomarkers in various risk populations; and, 3) how to
facilitate the development of high-throughput, sensitive assay methods to validate biomarkers that are useful in
early detection of early-stage cancers or their lethal precursors. This application is in direct response to NOSI

The non-fluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder
defined by the presence of agrammatic aphasia and/or apraxia of speech that commonly results from a 4-
repeat tauopathy. During the previous 2 cycles of the R01 we used neuroimaging to characterize the patterns
of neurodegeneration and structural and functional breakdowns in connectivity associated with nfvPPA.
However, little is known about how these brain changes are related to, or driven by, underlying biological
processes. Two important biological mechanisms relevant to nfvPPA are deposition of the protein tau and
neuroinflammation. In the 2nd cycle of the R01 we assessed tau deposition in vivo using PET. In the 3rd cycle
we will focus on assessing the role of neuroinflammation and other biological processes. The first aim
of the grant is to characterize the patterns of neuroinflammation in the brain using PET imaging with the 3rd
generation ligand 11C-ER176 and determine whether neuroinflammation changes over time and is associated
with clinical disease severity. The second aim is to determine whether biomarkers of pathological processes
measured from blood plasma, including neurofilament light chain, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, tau, and
inflammation biomarkers, are abnormal in nfvPPA. We will also assess whether these biomarkers change over
time and are associated with clinical disease severity. These first two aims will determine whether
neuroinflammation PET and blood plasma biomarkers are useful disease biomarkers in nfvPPA, and we will
determine whether these measures could be useful prognostic markers of future clinical decline. Our third
objective is to build upon knowledge gained from the first 2 cycles and determine how structural and functional
abnormalities in the brain, measured using structural MRI, diffusion tractography and resting state fMRI, are
related to neuroinflammation PET and blood plasma biomarkers. This aim will help model the degree to which
these biological processes relate to other more established breakdowns in brain structure and function. To
accomplish these aims we will recruit 50 patients with nfvPPA, and each participant will undergo three serial
assessments one year apart. At each assessment, patients will have a neurological and speech-language
assessment, 11C-ER176 neuroinflammation PET and a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan that will include
resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging sequences. A blood sample will be collected from all
patients at both visits. Blood samples were also collected in the 2nd cycle of the R01 and hence blood plasma
biomarkers will be measured in 100 nfvPPA patients. We will also recruit 50 cognitively normal healthy controls
who will undergo identical neuroimaging and provide a blood sample. This renewal is highly significant as
results gained will be critical to understand the biology of nfvPPA and mechanisms of disease spread.
Furthermore, this work may also help provide potential mechanistic treatment targets for nfvPPA and establish
disease biomarkers for prognosis and for future research studies and clinical trials in patients with nfvPPA.",SUCCESS

 Neurological and psychiatric disorders affect millions of people in the United States and worldwide, and produce
a third of all health care costs. Recent research has produced encouraging evidence that adaptive neuromodulation
can induce nervous system plasticity that produces long-lasting improvements in certain neurological disorders
such as stroke. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that the technologies that support these
demonstrations remain painfully inadequate and inaccessible for both research and clinical application: current
non-invasive technologies are typically imprecise; and current invasive technologies, which are more precise, are
currently only available with serious restrictions for human use. Moreover, all of the few existing neuromodulation
platforms for human use require substantial expertise in diverse areas of engineering, physiology, and regulatory
domains that is not available to most groups. This lack of availability of sufﬁciently capable and readily useable
neuromodulation technologies greatly impedes the development, application, and optimization of new adaptive
protocols for improving symptoms of devastating neurological and psychiatric disorders.
 The purpose of the project proposed here is to address this critical issue by developing, validating, and widely
sharing with the community an easy-to-use adaptive neuromodulation ecosystem (comprised of technology and
protocols) that is optimized for the needs of invasive basic and clinical research. We will validate this ecosystem in
a canine model, and disseminate it with appropriate documentation to other scientists and clinicians through three
project-related test sites and three workshops. In accord with this objective, we will:
1. Develop a general-purpose hardware/software neuromodulation platform for invasive neuromodulation research
2. Develop and validate an ecosystem for adaptive neuromodulation research and clinical application
3. Disseminate this ecosystem of technologies and protocols
 Achieving these three aims will create, validate, and disseminate the ﬁrst comprehensive ecosystem that
facilitates the conception, development, and clinical application of invasive adaptive neuromodulation protocols.
We expect that the availability of this ecosystem will greatly increase activities in basic and clinical neuromodulation
research that will lead to new understanding of the neural underpinnings of normal and abnormal function and will
thereby accelerate the development of novel adaptive neuromodulation protocols to improve treatment for many
devastating neurological disorders.",SUCCESS

Background: Increased arterial stiffness has been associated with indicators of damage to the brain including
presence of white matter hyperintensity, infarctions, and brain atrophy as assessed with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). When vessels lose their ability to mechanically absorb the effects of pulsatile flow, that
pulsatility is transmitted to the vasculature in the brain leading to deleterious changes in the brain tissue.
Understanding the effect of ultrasound measured viscoelastic mechanical properties of central conduit (e.g.,
carotid) arteries relative to MRI measured brain health indicators could result in a very important tool for
predicting and managing changes in brain function. This research project aims to address these unmet and
critical needs to develop techniques for the accurate and translatable ultrasound measurement of
viscoelastic arterial mechanical properties and evaluate associations with structural changes in the brain.
Methods: Ultrasound is a first-line imaging modality for vascular evaluation, but most clinical scanners do not
have the ability to evaluate the elastic or viscoelastic mechanical properties of vessels in an accurate,
quantitative manner with high temporal resolution. In the first cycle of this grant, we developed an ultrasound-
based method called arterial dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (ADUV) that utilizes acoustic radiation force to
stimulate high-frequency (200-1500 Hz) waves in the arterial wall, followed by high frame rate ultrasound to
measure the wave motion, which is used to characterize arterial viscoelastic mechanical properties.
However, our research revealed that several aspects of ADUV could be further improved before being used on
a daily basis in the clinic. Among these improvements are increasing the wave motion signal-to-noise ratio,
making precise measurements of the vessel geometry with ultrasound, and improving our inversion and
classification frameworks. With these improved ADUV methods, we will evaluate how the viscoelastic
properties of the carotid artery are associated with the health of the brain as judged using MRI brain
morphology data. With the strong collaborative team including expertise in cardiovascular medicine, radiology,
ultrasound engineering, waveguide modeling, inverse problems, data reduction and classification, we will bring
ADUV closer to widespread translation with the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1) Optimize ADUV to enhance motion measurement quality for more accurate and precise
 mechanical property estimation.
Aim 2) Develop advanced mathematical models for estimation of arterial mechanical properties and
 classification of disease state.
Aim 3) Correlate ADUV measurements of carotid artery viscoelasticity with MRI indicators of brain
 health in patients.",SUCCESS

Focal bone marrow biopsies of the posterior iliac crest are the gold standard for diagnosing multiple
myeloma, yet they do not reflect the spatial and genomic heterogeneity of the disease. Almost 25% of

This inconsistency in bone marrow sampling could result in falsely reassuring prognoses for patients
with aggressive disease. Whole-body imaging presents an unrealized opportunity to derive image
features in the bone marrow that reflect the cytogenetic diversity of clonal plasma cells. Several
advanced imaging modalities are used for diagnosis and disease management. An alternative
approach is to optimize one imaging modality for these tasks. Recently FDA approved photon-

composition quantification and lytic lesion detection throughout the whole skeleton. In addition, the
quantitative accuracy of the spectral data can be used to determine changes in bone marrow and
intralesional fat fraction, an indicator of treatment response. This proposal’s specific objective is to

The social and economic implications of dementia is greatest in women because of their longer life expectancy
and resulting elevated risk for dementia compared to men, and this risk of dementia in women may be, in part,
modulated by ovarian hormones. Although premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy (PBO) is associated with a
reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer, it is also associated with an increased risk of dementia and other
neurological diseases later in life. It is estimated that one in ten U.S. women have undergone abrupt endocrine
disruption by having their ovaries removed before reaching natural menopause and this rate is even higher in
African American/Black (AA) women. For the large number of women who underwent prophylactic PBO over
the past decade, it is critical that the pathologic mechanisms by which PBO influences the risk of dementia
should be determined in a rigorous manner for preventive approaches. The most common pathologies that
contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular disease.
Our goal is to understand the effects of abrupt disruption of ovarian hormones before the onset of menopause
on imaging biomarkers of AD and cerebrovascular disease pathophysiology later in life. We will enroll 150
women who underwent PBO and 150 women who did not undergo PBO drawn from a well-characterized and
established population-based cohort. Because our current cohort is predominantly White in Mayo Clinic
Rochester, we plan to enrich this cohort with a new AA cohort from Mayo Clinic Florida to reach a sample of
400 women (200 with and 200 without PBO). We hypothesize that imaging biomarkers of AD and
cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive function will be abnormal both cross-sectionally and longitudinally in
women who underwent PBO compared to referent women who did not undergo PBO, and that this difference
will be modified by race (AA versus White), age at PBO, and APOE ε4. Findings from the proposed project
have implications both for research and for clinical practice. Findings will contribute to clarifying the
mechanisms underlying the development of dementia in women who underwent PBO. In addition, they hold
the potential to alter the clinical practice paradigms related to PBO for non-malignant indications and outside of
the setting of high genetic risk of ovarian cancer. For the one in ten women currently facing the decision to
undergo PBO, determining the late life effects of PBO on the brain is critical for maintaining cognitive health in
the long-term.",SUCCESS

in which 3-D images are reconstructed from a limited number of low-dose x-ray source projections. DBT offers
superior tissue visualization allowing for the direct measurement of the actual volume of dense tissue, rather
than an estimated percent or volume (from a 2-D mammogram). Since breast density is a strong predictor of
masking and risk, DBT volumetric density measures, including our recently developed and first of its kind, fully
automated 3-D measure, have the potential to improve individualized breast cancer (BC) risk prediction. No
studies to date have evaluated DBT volumetric density measures in large, diverse cohorts or subpopulations to
understand the impact of these measures to improve prediction of masking and risk in order to tailor prevention
and screening approaches. Our goal is to comprehensively examine DBT volumetric density measures
as risk factors for invasive, interval and advanced BC, and evaluate their impact on clinically relevant
BC risk models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms across multiple racial groups. We propose this
research in three large breast screening cohorts that perform routine DBT, each with comprehensive clinical
risk factors, multiple DBT per woman, follow-up and BC outcomes. Specifically, we will establish a nested
case-control study of over 3,000 invasive BC cases and 9,000 controls matched on facility, age, race, ethnicity,
date of enrollment DBT and follow-up time and estimate novel research and commercial DBT volumetric
measures as well as ascertain clinical BI-RADS density from DBT screening exams from enrollment up to 6
months prior to diagnosis (or corresponding follow-up for controls). In Aim 1, we will evaluate DBT volumetric
density measures and their combinations as risk factors for invasive, interval and advanced BC, at enrollment
DBT exam, as well as DBT exams within five years of the cancer (or follow-up for controls), using state of the

age, race, menopausal status and body mass index. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the contribution of DBT
volumetric density measures to clinical BC risk models, including the BCSC 5-year risk model, the novel BCSC
6-year cumulative risk model for advanced cancer, and secondarily, the Tyrer-Cuzick model for both 5 and 10-
year risk. Using these results, we will determine the impact of DBT density measures on high-risk thresholds
for preventative therapy and tailored imaging. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the contribution of DBT
volumetric density measures to three novel AI algorithms developed for BC risk and detection, with risk of
invasive, advanced and interval BC in the short- and longer-term. Our innovative study will be the largest to
inform how novel DBT volumetric density measures can augment BC risk-stratification and prediction
across multiple races and build a diverse resource to evaluate new DBT measures and risk models as
they evolve. These findings will build an evidence base to inform personalized prevention approaches.",SUCCESS

While most forms of dementia arise from irreversible, degenerative processes, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
symptoms can often be alleviated by placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to divert cerebrospinal fluid from the
characteristically enlarged ventricles. However, due to overlapping clinical and biomarker phenotypes with other
common age-related disorders, NPH remains substantially underdiagnosed and undertreated. Even when
diagnosed, current methods are limited in predicting outcomes of shunt surgery, particularly when considering
noninvasive methods.
Since the disorder was first described, it has been hypothesized that the intracranial mechanical environment was
involved in NPH pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently reported that NPH is associated with a
characteristic pattern of brain viscoelasticity, as measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Furthermore,
the presence of this pattern is sensitive and specific for differentiating NPH patients from healthy volunteers and those
with Alzheimer’s clinical syndrome. While MRE is an accurate diagnostic biomarker for NPH, we expect that with
further technical development, MRE will also enable accurate prediction of treatment outcomes. In our preliminary
data, patients with low brain stiffness are less likely to benefit from shunting. However, these predictions are not yet
accurate enough to use clinically. We hypothesize that the existing discrepancies arise from an ambiguity that low
brain stiffness, as measured by current technology, can result either from decreased stiffness in the solid tissue matrix
or increased fluid content in the extracellular space. These two effects must be disentangled to identify the patients
with preserved matrix stiffness as those most likely to benefit from shunting.
Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to develop an MRE framework that jointly leverages strain and diffusion
measurements to estimate the viscoelastic properties of the solid matrix while accounting for interspersed
extracellular fluid. In Aim 1, we will modify the forward model of our machine learning-based inversion framework to
account for subvoxel fluid elements. We will then evaluate the algorithm’s accuracy in simulation and phantom
experiments, along with its repeatability in vivo. In Aim 2, we will compare the diagnostic accuracy of the new method
against existing methods, confirming that this solid-fluid mixture framework can similarly discriminate patients with
NPH from healthy controls and those with Alzheimer’s dementia. Finally, using objective measures of gait collected
before and after surgery, we will test the overall study hypothesis that baseline solid matrix stiffness estimates
(accounting for fluid) can predict the degree of gait improvement following shunt placement.
The proposed technology represents a fundamental shift in the field of brain MRE toward biophysically inspired
modeling. Most importantly, the success of this proposal will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of NPH with
the potential to directly impact patient care.",SUCCESS

""Seizure Prediction"", ""Physiological Signals"", and ""Machine Learning"" are explicit keywords.","For most individuals living with epilepsy, seizures are relatively infrequent events occupying a small fraction of
their life. Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures (typically only minutes per month),
people with epilepsy take anti-seizure drugs (ASD) daily, suffer ASD related side effects, and spend their lives
dreading when the next seizure will strike. The apparent randomness of seizures is associated with significant
psychological consequences. In addition, despite daily ASD, approximately 1/3 of patients continue to have
seizures. We hypothesize that epilepsy can be more effectively treated, both the seizures and their
psychological impact, by providing patients with real-time seizure forecasting.
There is strong evidence that focal epilepsy is associated with a variable seizure risk that may enable adaptive
therapy targeting periods of high seizure probability. Periods of low seizure probability could require lower
ASD doses, reducing exposure and side effects. We propose that high seizure probability states will respond to
adaptive electrical brain stimulation (aEBS). In addition, patients could alter their activities during periods of
high seizure probability to reduce injury and manage their ASD and activities.
The hypotheses driving this proposal are that 1.) seizures can be prevented (reduced incidence) by targeted
EBS therapy during the pre-ictal state 2.) seizures are not random events, and that brain states associated with
low and high seizure probability can be reliably classified using machine learning methods applied to
physiologic signals and used to adaptively change EBS parameters. 3.) Furthermore, we propose forecasting
can be improved using multi-modal features beyond passive iEEG recordings, including active brain probing
with electrical stimulation (impedance & evoked potentials), core temperature, ECG and serum immunological
markers. Goal: Develop reliable seizure forecasting (>90% sensitivity) with few false positives (<1% time in
warning) and demonstrate modulation of seizure risk and reduction of focal seizures using aEBS.",SUCCESS

behavioral traits. Obesity phenotypes include abnormal satiation (i.e., requiring more calories at each meal to
achieve fullness), abnormal postprandial satiety (i.e., accelerated gastric emptying and increased postprandial
hunger), emotional eating (i.e., eating in response to positive or negative emotions), and abnormal resting energy
expenditure (i.e., low resting energy expenditure). In pilot clinical studies, these obesity phenotypes have
predicted weight loss response to anti-obesity medications and bariatric endoscopic devices. We recently
published data from a 12-week proof-of-concept, non-randomized clinical trial of 165 patients in which 84
participants received lifestyle interventions designed for each phenotypic trait they had and 81 received standard
lifestyle recommendations. The phenotype-tailored lifestyle intervention (PLI) resulted in greater weight loss
compared to the standard lifestyle intervention (SLI) approach for obesity. Patients in the PLI showed
improvement of their phenotype-defining trait(s). Improvement in these traits may explain the greater weight loss
as they potentially counteract physiologic and behavioral adaptations of the weight-reduced state. To validate
these data, we must study PLI in a longer-term and randomized clinical trial. Furthermore, the current methods
used to identify phenotypes in our preliminary studies are time-consuming, invasive, expensive, limited to a few
academic centers, and not accessible for most patients. In an academic-industry partnership, we have developed
a novel biomarker test that predicts obesity phenotypes but that needs to be validated in a large prospective
cohort. As such, we have formulated the following central hypothesis: “tailoring lifestyle recommendations to
obesity phenotypes will enhance long-term weight loss outcomes in adult patients with obesity”. To test our
central hypothesis, we propose a 12-month randomized, blinded, parallel clinical trial in adults with
obesity to test three aims: 1) To compare the outcomes of PLI vs. SLI program; 2) After a 12-month weight loss
program, to compare the long-term effect of PLI compared to SLI on physiological (i.e., satiation, postprandial
satiety, energy expenditure) and behavioral (i.e., emotional eating) adaptations; and 3) To explore whether a
phenotype biomarker predicts weight loss in response to PLI compared to SLI. Significance: Our study has the
potential to introduce an individualized treatment that targets pathophysiological and behavioral phenotypes of
energy balance to enhance and maintain weight loss outcomes.",SUCCESS

End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) affects a significant number of patients in the U.S. (>785,000 in 2018), and
presents substantial medical, social, and economic challenges. Kidney transplantation is the preferred
treatment for ESKD. However, there is a pressing unmet clinical need for better methods that allow for
noninvasive, accurate, and frequent characterization and monitoring of kidney allograft injury. Such methods
are critical for enhancing long-term allograft survival and improving the quality of life for the kidney transplant
recipients. The change of kidney parenchymal microvasculature and perfusion has been shown to play a vital
role in the progression of allograft injury, while noninvasive tools for imaging and quantification of allograft
microvasculature are still lacking. In this project, we will develop a novel noninvasive, robust, and translatable
super-resolution ultrasound imaging (SRUI) technology. This technology aims to provide imaging and
quantification of parenchymal microvasculature to enable reliable assessment of allograft injuries. In our pilot
patient study of transplant kidneys, parameters derived from SRUI correlate strongly with pathology (r ≥ 0.9).
Aim 1: Technical development. We will advance and optimize the novel SRUI technology for kidney allograft
imaging and quantification. New signal enhancement and localization methods will be developed to improve
the overall performance of SRUI in clinical settings. We will advance the SRUI to 3D to enable more
comprehensive assessments of the graft microvasculature. We will develop novel quantitative SRUI metrics,
including microvascular density, tortuosity, flow speed, cortex perfusion and micro-resistive index.
Aim 2: Clinical patient study. We will study 158 patients to investigate the value of SRUI for kidney allograft
assessment using biopsy histology as validation. The association of SRUI metrics with histological injuries will
be assessed. The ability of SRUI, conventional ultrasound, and clinical measures (eGFR, proteinuria) to
distinguish between kidney allografts with varying degrees of histological injuries will be evaluated. We will also
assess the inter-sonographer reproducibility of the SRUI technology in a subset of 46 patients.
Aim 3: Longitudinal follow-up study. We will conduct a longitudinal follow-up study in 62 patients to assess
the efficacy of SRUI in monitoring and predicting the progression of allograft injury, using biopsy histology as
validation. The association of changes in SRUI metrics with the changes in histological injuries from 1-year to
2-year post-transplant will be assessed. We will study if SRUI metrics or combined metrics at 1-year post-
transplant, or the changes of these metrics from 1-year to 2-year, can distinguish between allografts without
and with histological worsening during this period.
Successful completion of this project will lead to a noninvasive, accessible, cost-effective, and translatable tool
to address the critical clinical need for reliable and frequent characterization of allograft in transplant recipients.",SUCCESS

Prevalence of pulmonary disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the United States has doubled in the
last 10 years, and Mycobacterium avium pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) is the most common. Treatment requires
≥3 antibiotics for >12 months and efficacy remain low. Given this intense treatment regimen and limited efficacy,
antibiotic therapy is not always advisable. In fact, ~50% of patients will attain culture conversion with observation
alone or with bronchial hygiene treatments. There is currently no way to predict which patients will improve with
or without antibiotic treatment. The result of this uncertainty is prolonged ineffective treatment which risks side
effects, drive drug resistance and extend treatment duration. We propose an interdisciplinary approach that
combines clinical, immunological and pharmacological data. We will integrate these datasets from retrospective
and prospective cohorts using machine learning and mechanistic computational simulations with the goal of
developing a disease progression risk score (DP-RS) for patients managed without antibiotics (Aim 1), and a
treatment failure risk score (TF-RS) for patients treated with guidelines-based antibiotic regimens (Aim 2). Such
risk scores can help to predict patients at risk of disease progression without antibiotics or treatment failure with
antibiotics, so they can be prioritized for closer observation or intensified treatment, respectively.
For patients who do not receive antibiotics (Aim 1) we will a) use retrospective clinical data from Indiana, Florida
and Minnesota to train and test random forest algorithms to predict disease progression and validate our predic-
tions against prospective clinical cohorts from Florida and Minnesota; b) identify antigen specific T cells re-
sponses associated with disease progression; c) predict tissue-level disease progression based on patient-spe-
cific T-cell responses using mechanistic computational models; and d) train and test simulation assisted random
forest (SARF) algorithms that integrate clinical, immunological and computational data to predict disease pro-
gression and derive the DP-RS.
For patients who receive antibiotics (Aim 2) we will a) use retrospective clinical data (Indiana, Florida, Minnesota)

spective clinical cohorts (Florida, Minnesota); b) identify antigen specific T cells responses associated with treat-
ment failure; c) identify serum and bronchoalveolar lavage pharmacokinetics associated with treatment failure;
d) predict tissue-level treatment response based on patient-specific T-cell responses and pharmacokinetics us-
ing mechanistic computational models; and d) train and test SARF algorithms that integrate clinical, immunolog-
ical, pharmacological and computational data to predict treatment failure and derive the TF-RS.
Together, this work will provide fundamental insights into clinical, immunological and pharmacological contribu-

 2 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States and its impact is only growing with
 3 shifting demographics. The development of powerful biomarkers, measuring amyloid deposition, tau accumulation,
 4 and neurodegeneration, has provided important insights into the pathophysiology of AD and AD-related dementias
 5 (ADRD). Nonetheless, given the large variability across individuals, our understanding of the link between pathology
 6 and cognitive dysfunction remains incomplete. Structural factors contribute significantly to this pathology-cognition
 7 disconnect and are termed as “brain reserve.” There is a critical need for objective measures of reserve that will
 8 improve the assessment of individual prognosis and guide therapy.
 9 Brain biomechanics are an understudied structural feature of the brain, due in large part to the difficulty in measuring
10 relevant biomechanical states in vivo. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is currently unmatched for
11 noninvasive measurement of brain mechanical properties. We have previously demonstrated that brain stiffness is
12 reduced due to AD, and our group and others have demonstrated in multiple studies that brain stiffness is a significant
13 reporter of cognitive function. However, previous studies face important limitations, namely technologies that were
14 optimized for reliability over resolution, and incomplete pathological assessment. Therefore, we will investigate two
15 aims with the overall goals to (1) advance MRE technology in order to (2) evaluate of the role of biomechanics in
16 brain reserve.
17 In Aim 1, we will optimize our machine learning-based MRE inversion framework by incorporating new a priori
18 information into the model that is specific to the brain. These advances to the model include the incorporation of
19 partial volume effects to reduce atrophy-related bias, and mechanical anisotropy to accurately model the coherent
20 structure of white matter tracts. Each advance will be tested in simulation and phantom experiments, and finally in
21 vivo for its ability to boost sensitivity to key AD/ADRD processes.
22 In Aim 2, we will use these tools to simultaneously map the mechanical signature of 4 pathophysiological processes
23 including amyloid, tau, white matter hyperintensities, and cardiometabolic conditions. Using first a discovery data set,
24 we will extract the mechanical feature that best reports cognitive performance, both globally and in specific domains.
25 These MRE-based features will then be evaluated in an independent test set for their ability to predict concurrent and
26 future cognitive performance. Finally, we will assess the unique value of mechanical biomarkers to predict cognitive
27 performance, using a parallel analysis but controlling for existing biomarkers derived from anatomical, functional, and
28 diffusion MRI.
29 In sum, the success of this proposal will shed new light on alterations to brain biomechanics with respect to
30 AD/ADRD processes, and their role as a buffer between pathology and cognition.",SUCCESS

 Genomic variants in an individual may be either inherited (i.e., transmitted through the germline) or
generated by mutagenesis in post-zygotic cells. Widespread genomic mosaicism in somatic cells of
phenotypically normal individuals is now well established. In certain cases, it is known that mutations have
causative role in diseases and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. But generally, little is known about to
what extent natural mosaicism influences an individual’s susceptibility to disease.
 In our recent study we discovered a phenomenon of hypermutability in adult brains. Hypermutability was
not related to diagnosis but increased with age, reaching at least 3% population frequency (95% confidence
interval) for brains over 40 years old. The phenomenon of hypermutability could have implications for a number
of conditions. Since it correlates with aging, it could be important for age-related neurodegenerative diseases;
or, as it involves mutations in cancer-related genes, it may be related to predisposition for brain cancer.
Alternatively, hypermutability may reflect imbalances (expansion/contraction) between cell lineages in the
developing brain.
 We have three hypotheses explaining hypermutability. The goal of the proposed study is to firmly
establish the origin(s) of hypermutability. To conduct the study, we will first expand the set of hypermutable
brains (Aim 1). The ultimate judgement about the origins will be made from the regional distribution and
frequency of mutations in the brains (Aim 2), the cell type(s) carrying the mutations (Aim 3), and proving (or
disproving) that mutations in the hypermutable brains arose from a clonally expanded cell lineage (Aim 4).
Proving the hypothesized origins of hypermutability will be a fundamental contribution to understanding brain
development and aging in humans and will lay the foundation for future studies of the underlying mechanisms.",SUCCESS

 In 2010 we proposed, and in 2013 revised, a hypothetical model of the temporal evolution of biomarkers
and clinical symptoms for individuals in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathway. The biomarker model is based
on a hypothesized cause and effect sequence which can be summarized as: amyloidosis (A), promotes
tauopathy (T), which promotes neurodegeneration (N), which is the proximate cause of clinical symptoms (C).
For simplicity, we use this ATNC notation: A T  N  C. The current cycle of AG011378 was designed to
test aspects of this model that were testable using imaging; however, a major missing element when the
current cycle AG011378 began in 2013 was a method to measure fibrillar tau deposits with imaging. Tau PET
has recently become available and, consequently for the first time, imaging biomarkers exist to ascertain three
of the most important pathologic features of AD: amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration.
 An important insight gained from the current cycle of AG011378 was that modeling AD biomarkers on the
assumption that AD is the only pathological process present in the general aging population is conceptually
flawed. We argue that biomarker modeling within the general aging population should accommodate at least
three broad groups based on currently available biomarkers: (1) individuals with no biomarker abnormalities
whose future biomarker profiles are unknown; (2) individuals along the Alzheimer’s continuum; and (3) a
heterogeneous group with primarily suspected non-AD pathologies (SNAP).
 Our aims in this renewal are based on modeling longitudinal amyloid PET (A), tau PET (T), and MRI (N)
biomarkers. The overarching goals of the renewal are to empirically evaluate our hypothetical model of AD
biomarkers and to create complementary imaging biomarker models for individuals who are not in the
Alzheimer’s continuum. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions over time across multiple pathways. Aim 1
employs hidden Markov models. 1a) To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions in the
Alzheimer’s continuum, 1b) To model the sequence of biomarker and clinical transitions in SNAP pathways.
Aim 2. To model continuous biomarker and clinical trajectories over time across multiple pathways. Aim 2
analyses employ non-linear latent class mixed models. 2a) To model biomarker and clinical trajectories in the
Alzheimer’s continuum, 2b) To model biomarker and clinical trajectories in SNAP pathways.
Aim 3. To formulate mechanistic inferences about biomarker and clinical changes over time across multiple
pathways. 3a) inferences in the Alzheimer’s continuum, 3b) inferences in SNAP pathways.
Aim 4: To establish temporal ordering of topographic spread of A, T, and N within each modality, across
imaging modalities, and establish how these temporal orderings relate to cognitive impairment within (4a) the
Alzheimer’s continuum and (4b) the SNAP pathways. Aim 4 uses a conditional probability approach.",SUCCESS

Molecularly diverse gliomas may leverage convergent metabolic survival pathways that can be therapeutically targetable. Microdialysis enables sampling of the extracellular microenvironment and represents a previously underutilized opportunity to characterize and pharmacodynamically monitor living human gliomas, in situ. Our preliminary data from intraoperatively acquired glioma microdialysate reveal strong enrichment for methionine-associated pathways of cancer resiliency, including polyamine synthesis. Specifically, results to date have identified guanidinoacetate (GAA) as the most highly upregulated metabolite in glioma microdialysate, which we hypothesize results from upregulated polyamine synthesis within the tumor. This study will determine the reproducibility and potential therapeutic implications of our findings across a larger cohort of gliomas, asking if microdialysis could be leveraged to obtain mechanistic feedback during early phase clinical evaluation of candidate therapies. To interrogate methionine metabolism human gliomas in situ, we will perform intra-operative microdialysis and methionine tracing, comparing the metabolome of microdialysate and tissue from tumor and adjacent brain. Resected tissue will be used to determine the cellular source of methionine-associated metabolites. Recent studies have demonstrated that diverse tumors can escape DMFO-mediated polyamine metabolism by upregulation of polyamine transporters. Dual blockade of polyamine synthesis and polyamine transports with  DMFO+AMXT 1501 has been shown to improve outcomes in preclinical models. To mechanistically interrogate polyamine metabolism we will perform a combination of preclinical and clinical studies leveraging microdialysis. In a phase 0 study, patients will be randomized to vehicle, DMFO, or DMFO+AMXT 1501, prior to dual administration of DMFO+AMXT to determine the extracellular pharmacodynamic changes induced by early therapeutic stress. Collectively, these studies will test how microdialysis can be used to perform biochemical reconnaissance within the live human glioma, with and without therapeutic challenge, to gain “glioma intelligence from behind enemy lines.”",SUCCESS

Synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths have increased sharply. Fentanyl is driving many of those overdose
deaths. However, oxycodone is one of the most prescribed opioid medications in the US. Current in vitro assays
and in vivo models designed to study the pathophysiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) and to discover potential
therapeutic targets are useful, but there is a need for additional model systems. Our preliminary data and serval
preclinical study using single-cell sequencing have revealed that each opioid agent might have unique molecular
profiles and mechanisms of action. Those findings highlight the need for additional models to evaluate drug
action in the brain at the single-cell level. Our research team combines expertise in addiction medicine,
pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics, expertise required to develop a computational and experimental
framework to integrate gene expression and chromatin accessibility in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived brain organoids. The goal of the proposed study is to provide novel mechanistic insight into drug action
at single-cell resolution. Our research strategy involves the use of single-cell sequencing technology and
iPSC-derived 3D brain organoids to identify molecular signatures for OUD using two commonly prescribed
synthetic opioids: oxycodone and fentanyl as molecular probes. Aim 1, we will define molecular characteristics
of response to synthetic opioids: oxycodone and fentanyl exposure of iPSC-derived forebrain organoids from
both OUD patients and healthy controls at the single-cell level. Aim 2, we propose to reconstruct transcriptional
regulons in different cell types in the brain organoids by applying novel network biology approaches to prioritize
potential candidates, to detect meaningful biological information embedded in the sea of Big Data and to uncover
novel regulatory mechanisms that explain the properties of biological phenotypes. These approaches could help
to develop mechanistic hypothesis for experimental validation. Aim 3, we will study genes and pathways
identified from Aim 1 and Aim 2 with regard to their potential use as novel drug targets for OUD treatment or
prevention, by pursuing functional genomic studies using appropriate iPS-derived CNS cell types and brain
organoids Our findings will enhance the general understanding of drug mechanism(s) of action and the
underlying pathophysiology responsible for opioid addiction in a drug-dependent fashion, thus opening new
avenues to discover novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of OUD. In summary, this proposal is based on
extensive preliminary data, and decades of experience in using drugs as “molecular probes” for underlying
genomic and other omic mechanisms. As a result, the proposed studies have significant implications for
molecular mechanisms leading to understanding of the pathophysiology of OUD as well as the discovery of novel
therapeutic agents for OUD treatment and/or prevention. If successful, our research approaches could be

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a globally prevalent disorder (~11%) characterized by an alteration
in stool form/frequency in association with abdominal discomfort or pain. IBS is categorized into
constipation, diarrhea or mixed (IBS-C, IBD-D, IBS-M) based on the predominant stool form/frequency. The
pathophysiology of IBS is complex and therapeutic options targeting the underlying pathophysiology in IBS
are limited. Recent studies support a role for gut microbial metabolites in maintaining normal
gastrointestinal (GI) function, but how changes in different microbial metabolites and interactions among
these metabolites affect molecular pathways involved in IBS pathophysiology remains a critical knowledge
gap. Hence, it is not surprising that the current empirically designed microbial therapies (probiotics) have
largely proven ineffective in IBS. To address this gap, in the previous grant cycle we focused on the
bacterial metabolite tryptamine and found tryptamine increases secretion and mucus release in a 5-
HT4R dependent manner, accelerates transit, and protects against inflammation in rodent models. The
observations were supported by our finding of elevated levels of tryptamine in IBS-D in our human study. In
the same longitudinal multi-omics human study, the most consistent finding in IBS-C across multiple -omics
platforms were significant decreases in stool hypoxanthine and butyrate. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine the physiologic relevance of these metabolites by identifying the molecular
pathways affected by each of these metabolites that are relevant to IBS-C. Our central hypothesis based
on prior research and our preliminary data is that hypoxanthine is an effector metabolite that
accelerates GI transit by increasing enterochromaffin (EC) cell serotonin release while butyrate is a regulatory
metabolite that augments the biologic activity of effector metabolites. This will be tested in two Aims: In Aim
1, we will determine the mechanism by which hypoxanthine increases EC cell serotonin release and
accelerates GI transit and in Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which butyrate regulates EC cell
responses to effector metabolites and the resultant effects on GI function. We will use Ca2+ imaging in
organoids/primary EC cell culture from novel transgenic mice, heterologous receptor expression with site-
directed mutagenesis, and epigenomic and transcriptomics data, combined with ex vivo colon
preparations, gnotobiotic- and EC cell-depleted mouse models, isogenic bacterial mutants, and novel
encapsulation methods to address the above aims. Our findings will uncover specific pathways by which
these microbial metabolites affect GI transit and allow development of novel mechanism-based microbial

The prevalence and burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide. Patients who undergo
radical or partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer resemble the general population with comorbidities, but with
the difference that a majority undergo pre- and post-surgery abdominal imaging. Despite successful surgical
tumor removal, there is a concern for future progressive CKD. Following nephrectomy, the unaffected kidney
undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, and the degree of hypertrophy and kidney function decline depend on
the comorbidity burden and the amount of the removed kidney tissue. With the recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI)--based quantification of kidney volumes from CT scans, there is an opportunity to evaluate
automated imaging biomarkers as prognostic tools. There are also algorithms that quantify the number and
volume of simple parenchymal cysts and many radiomic/texture features. The Co-Principal Investigators in this

anatomy and advanced biostatistical skills. Dr. Kline has expertise in AI and developing advanced image
processing techniques. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that macrostructural findings on
imaging of the retained (non-operated) kidney after radical or partial nephrectomy are prognostic for
progressive CKD. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the degree of compensatory hypertrophy in the
retained kidney after nephrectomy predicts progressive CKD. Using a recently created deep learning algorithm
we developed, we will quantify the kidney, cortex, and medullary volumes in pre-surgery and follow-up CT
scans (at median 1-year post-surgery). From these volumes, we will calculate the degree of compensatory
changes in kidney volumes and assess their association with baseline comorbidities and microstructural
measures. Finally, we will develop models to predict progressive CKD. In Aim 2, we will first optimize and
finalize training of the model to quantify cysts and their size in CT images and develop postprocessing steps to
separate cortical from medullary cysts. We will then develop models to assess whether the number and size of
cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney in pre-surgery scans, and changes in number and size
of cysts (overall, cortical, medullary) in the retained kidney over 1-year post-surgery, can predict progressive
CKD. In Aim 3, we will determine whether novel radiological imaging texture features on pre-surgery scans are
reflective of microstructural measures of nephron size and nephrosclerosis and whether kidney texture
features on follow-up CT scans predict progressive CKD. This research program will be facilitated by Mayo
Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment at all three sites dedicated to improving patient care.

Cognitive Aging and risk of Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's related dementias (AD/ADRD) is due to
multiple aging and pathological processes that are driven by several upstream brain mechanisms and risk
factors. The success of recent multi-domain interventions and our preliminary data suggests that multiple
mechanisms need to be targeted for effective dementia prevention. In 2018, we proposed a simplistic conceptual
framework that builds on existing concepts using the nomenclature of resistance in the context of avoiding AD
pathology and resilience in the context of coping with AD pathology for investigating these distinct mechanisms.
This proposal addresses an important barrier for developing effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for AD
dementia - the poor understanding of how upstream risk factors and brain mechanisms (resistance and
resilience) that could contribute to or protect from protein accumulation and neurodegeneration. Our central
hypothesis is that identifying upstream brain mechanisms of resistance and resilience and modeling the complex
inter-relationships between protective factors, brain mechanisms, and longitudinal changes in amyloid, tau, and
cognition will aid in effective design of dementia prevention strategies.
To test this hypothesis, our primary aim is to identify mechanisms of resistance and resilience using the existing
infrastructure of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) (individuals aged ≥50 years) and
Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) which maintains a comprehensive medical records-linkage system. We
will collect the following variables for this proposal: Genetics, Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), and
systemic health (up to 20 years prior to scan from REP), longitudinal PiB and tau PET, baseline cutting edge
MRI (high resolution T1/T2/FLAIR and multi-shell diffusion MRI to assess perivascular spaces, microstructural
integrity, and cortical thickness), and cognitive decline. Our secondary aim is to develop and validate MRI-
based resilience markers that can be used in the NIA-AA research framework alongside with AT(N) biomarkers
to adjust for individual variability in cognition. Considering brain health measures (other than those included in
the evaluation of N) as resilience markers will improve the prediction of cognitive decline across all aging and
dementia studies. These measures will be able to capture biological variability due to SDoH and systemic health
and facilitate better comparison of biomarkers across populations.",SUCCESS

Radiation dose is a major drawback of computed tomography (CT) imaging. While the long-term effects of
radiation are difficult to quantify, there is a continued desire to reduce radiation dose through technical
improvement. In theory, photon counting detectors (PCDs) provide several opportunities to reduce CT radiation
dose. In practice, however, PCD CT scanners today have shown only modest gains in dose efficiency
compared to scanners from prior generations for most scanning protocols. Several components of the CT
scanner must be re-engineered to benefit from the dose saving potential of PCDs. The objective of this work is
to perform this re-engineering by designing new components that can take advantage of radiation dose
reduction opportunities with PCD CT.
In Specific Aim 1, we will develop hardware that could improve quantum efficiency, or the fraction of incident
photons that are successfully detected. Today, about 40% of the x-rays that arrive at the detector are never
absorbed by the sensor. 30% of the x-rays are stopped by the anti-scatter grid, and 10% of the x-rays
penetrate the sensor without interaction due to the relatively low stopping power of the sensor. First, we will
experimentally demonstrate a lightweight, striped anti-scatter grid that will increase the number of primary
photons detected while providing a means for estimating residual scatter. The geometry of this grid introduces
striping in the detector signal, with stripe contrast proportional to the level of remaining scatter. Therefore, the
images themselves will contain a means to subtract the remaining scatter. Second, we will develop a guardrail
that can fluoresce a fraction of the punch-through photons and return them to the sensor. We will demonstrate
the guardrail experimentally in a CdTe benchtop PCD.
In Specific Aim 2, we turn to spectral nonidealities in PCD CT. PCDs suffer from pulse pileup and charge
sharing. We will experimentally test a pileup detection circuit that reroutes suspected pileup events into
separate counters. We show that this substantially reduces the impact of pileup and will simulate its use
together with charge summing modes to reduce charge sharing effects. Historically, charge summing modes
have not been used in CT applications because of their pileup penalty. We hypothesize that this mode could
be enabled by stronger pileup corrections, such as the one we will demonstrate. Charge summing modes also
improve dose efficiency for grayscale (non-spectral) tasks by eliminating double counting effects.
Successful completion of these Aims could allow PCDs to unlock their dose reduction potential and could

Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impaired motor and higher
cortical function. Pathologies underlying CBS are heterogeneous; ~60% have a 4-repeat (4R) tauopathy (CBS-
4R) and 20-30% have Alzheimer’s disease (CBS-AD). It has been shown that molecular pathology influences
patterns of brain atrophy in CBS, yet little is known about biological disease mechanisms underlying CBS and
how mechanisms are related to molecular pathology. This R01 will focus on assessing the biological
mechanism of neuroinflammation in CBS. Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of
different neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and 4R tauopathies, and has been linked mechanistically
to damage of the white matter which is a key feature of CBS. The first aim of the grant will use the PET ligand
1C-ER176 to assess the distribution of neuroinflammation in the brain and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and
Density Imaging (NODDI) to measure white matter microstructure. The second aim will measure biomarkers of
neuroinflammation from blood plasma, such as plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein and proinflammatory
cytokines. We will prospectively recruit 80 CBS patients, with each participant undergoing clinical testing, MRI
diffusion tensor imaging, ER176, Aβ and tau-PET, and a blood draw. The Aβ and tau PET will be used to
classify CBS patients with (CBS-AD) and without (CBS-4R) biomarker-confirmed AD. We will determine
whether patterns of ER176 uptake, NODDI abnormalities, and blood plasma metrics differ between CBS-AD
and CBS-4R and whether they differ compared to 30 healthy controls and 30 patients with amnestic AD. We
will also assess relationships between these different outcome measures and determine whether they are
related to markers of disease severity. These first two aims will determine the role of neuroinflammation and
white matter microstructure damage in CBS and whether neuroimaging and plasma metrics can be used as
indirect biomarkers of AD in CBS. Forty CBS patients will be brought back after two years to allow for the
assessment of longitudinal relationships. As we are unable to determine the exact molecular pathology
underlying CBS-4R during life, we will further this work in aim 3 by assessing our disease mechanisms of
interest in an autopsy cohort of 90 CBS patients with known pathology. We will measure burden of activated
microglia and astrocytes, myelin and tau proteins from brain tissue and determine whether burden differs
across the three most common pathologies underling CBS-4R (corticobasal degeneration n=30, progressive
supranuclear palsy n=30) and CBS-AD (n=30). Findings from aim 3 will complement and help validate findings
from our clinical cohort in aims 1&2. This grant is highly significant as results will help elucidate the mechanistic
role of neuroinflammation and white matter damage in CBS and determine the value of neuroimaging and
plasma measures as biomarkers of disease and pathology. This work may also provide potential mechanistic
treatment targets for CBS and biomarkers to help in the selection/stratification of patients for clinical trials.",SUCCESS

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with the impairment of many metabolic pathways,
including decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and secretion, increased glucagon, and the risk of developing type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Conversely, patients with diabetes have a higher prevalence of steatohepatitis and end-
stage liver disease. As an intermediate state of hyperglycemia easily detectable in clinical settings, prediabetes is
the condition that precedes T2DM but the progression is variable, which could increase over time with associated
risk factors. To date, the mechanisms underlying prediabetic progression are still not understood. We think
simultaneous imaging of the abdominal organs’ abnormalities along the liver-pancreas axis and measures of insulin
action, secretion, and hepatic extraction can provide insights into T2DM development, a better understanding of the
relationship between NAFLD and diabetes, and an opportunity to intervene in prediabetic progression.
The overall goal of this work is to develop an advanced multiparametric abdominal MRE method for
characterizing pathophysiologic state of the liver-pancreas axis and prediabetic progression in NAFLD.
• In Aim 1, A multifrequency, self-navigating, and hybrid radial-Cartesian 3D vector magnetic resonance
 elastography (MRE) technology will be developed and expanded on the liver, pancreas and fat data acquisition
 and image reconstruction. Ten healthy volunteers will be recruited during MRE driver, imaging sequence and
 reconstruction development and optimization. Benchmark for technical success will be evaluated with a test-retest
 repeatability and measurement agreement study on ten patients with diagnosed NAFLD.
• In Aim 2, We will perform quantitative imaging assessments of the liver-pancreas axis in a cross-sectional study in
 150 patients with diagnosed NAFLD with varying risk or progression to diabetes (i.e., 50 patients without diabetes,
 50 patients with prediabetes, 50 patients with diabetes). Laboratory and clinical data, as well as insulin secretion
 and action measurements, will be collected within 30 days of MRI/MRE. Precursory tissue abnormalities and
 integrative metabolic-mechanical models will be trained and evaluated to assess the risk of developing T2DM.
• In Aim 3, assuming 20% withdrawal rate, we plan to have one-year follow-up examinations in 120 patients out of
 those who have baseline examinations in Aim 2. The models trained in Aim 2 will be further tuned with longitudinal
 MRI/MRE changes for assessing bi-directional treatment effects on tissue composition, structural and metabolic
 features, bridging the cellular, gland, enzymes, and hormones to the liver-pancreas axis, thereby predicting
 progression or regression direction of diabetes development in NAFLD.
We anticipate that this program will provide initial validation of multiparametric MRI/MRE and the derived
surrogate to assess the liver-pancreas axis of diabetes progression in NAFLD. This project’s success will
also provide a valuable noninvasive assessment tool for emerging therapeutic interventions.",SUCCESS

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, especially constipation, affect >50% of persons with PD (PwPD). However,
these concepts are exclusively based on tertiary care studies that used incomplete definitions of constipation.
Our population study found that constipation preceded the motor symptoms of PD by up to 20 or more years.
Our proposal is predicated on the integrated, multi-hit hypothesis that environmental exposures, especially in
genetically vulnerable persons, are perpetuated by an inflammatory gut microbiome and epigenetic changes,
resulting in accumulation of misfolded α synuclein in the gut and its transfer to the central nervous system,
followed by enteric and central neurodegeneration, GI and anorectal dysfunctions, and GI symptoms in PD. This
proposal will assimilate the bigger-picture cellular networks that drive disease processes, enteric
neuropathology, brain-gut dysfunctions, and the clinical phenotype in PwPD-C and without constipation (PwPD-
noC). We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team from the Departments of Gastroenterology, Neurology,
Physiology, and Radiology and the Center for Individualized Medicine at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Gary Miller (Columbia
University), and Dr. Rodger Liddle (Duke University) to compare brain-gut dysfunctions (Aim 1), omics-based
disease signatures (Aim 2), and the exposome (Aim 3) in 60 PwPD-C, 60 PwPD-noC, and 30 healthy controls.
When integrated with the clinical phenotype, this information will identify biomarkers and pathways that
predispose to constipation in PwPD. Aim 1 will compare neurological and GI clinical features, in vivo GI functions
(GI transit and anorectal functions), enteric neuropathology (α-synuclein deposition in EEC and neurons and
neuronal loss) and neuroimaging abnormalities (18FFDG-PET and MRI) in PwPD-C, PwPD-noC, and healthy
controls. Aim 2 will discover changes in gut microbial composition and dynamics associated with PD-C by
assessing the fecal metagenome (Aim 2a) and the colonic mucosal transcriptome (Aim 2b) and epigenome (Aim
2c). Aim 3 will identify signatures associated with PD-C in and across the peripheral blood exposome and
metabolome. We will identify exogenous chemical exposures (e.g., pollutants and pesticides) representing the
exposome and endogenous small molecule metabolites representing biological pathways or the metabolome
using cutting-edge high-resolution mass spectroscopy platforms and environmental questionnaires. Integrated
with the epigenome and transcriptome, Aim 3 will likely enrich our understanding of the risk factors for PD.",SUCCESS

Incidence of autoimmune encephalitis exceeds that of infectious cause, but 50% percent (half of approximate
4000/year in the US) are IgG biomarker negative. Seronegativity hinders diagnosis and pathophysiologic
understanding in autoimmune encephalopathies (encephalitis, cerebellar ataxias and other movement
disorders). Novel IgG characterization, which attempts to address this gap, is linear and slow occurring at a
rate of 1-2 year (using standard tissue-based immunofluorescence assay [IFA] followed by western blots,
immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry). The long-term goal is to molecularly, clinically and
mechanistically characterize autoimmune encephalopathies, and develop targeted autoimmune therapies. The
overall objectives in this application, are to: 1) identify disease-specific biomarkers for seronegative
autoimmune encephalopathies; 2) molecularly validate novel biomarkers, and 3) clinically, radiologically and
immunologically deep-phenotype autoimmune encephalopathies. The central hypothesis is that seronegative
autoimmune encephalopathies are characterizable though biomarker discovery. The rationale for this project is
that biomarker discovery and translation could occur expeditiously, by leveraging complementary techniques in
parallel, that novel biomarkers could be molecularly validated, and that disorders associated with new
biomarkers could be neurologically and immunologically deep-phenotyped. To test the central hypothesis the
following three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Identify novel biomarkers, initially in 3 partly characterized
seronegative autoimmune encephalopathies; 2) determine validity of novel biomarkers; and 3) assess for
differentiated clinical phenotypes, and cytokine profile accompaniments. Under the first aim, serum and CSF
from seronegative autoimmune encephalopathy patients will be interrogated for neural antibodies using native
full-length protein microarrays, as principle technique, complemented by tissue and cell-based IFA for initial
IgG screening, and, as needed, phage immunoprecipitation sequencing, and mass spectrometry techniques
for verification. For the second aim, newly characterized IgGs will be validated in autoimmune encephalopathy
patients and controls by multiple antigen-specific methods (confocal indirect immunofluorescence, and
recombinant protein assays [western blot, cDNA-transfected cell-based]). For the third aim, patients with
autoimmune encephalopathies with characterized and validated neural IgGs will be deep-phenotyped clinically,
radiologically and immunologically, by evaluating for IgG effects in live neuron assays, and cytokine-chemokine
profiles. Remaining seronegative cohorts will be immunologically profiled by cytokine-chemokine assays. The
research proposed is innovative in the applicant’s opinion, as it focuses on multiplexed biomarker identification,
validation, and deep phenotyping. The proposed research is significant because disease-specific biomarkers,
with in-depth characterization, allow earlier diagnosis and treatment, and support disease mechanism studies.",SUCCESS

Psychiatric disorders remain a leading cause of disability in the US and are associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Early detection and treatment is essential to improving long-term outcomes, yet a substantial
proportion of patients with psychiatric complaints experience long diagnostic odysseys before receiving an
appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. “Learning health care systems” aim to short-circuit this
slow process by leveraging the diagnostic, treatment, and utilization patterns left behind in “big data” (e.g.,
clinical, genomic, and social determinants of health) to more efficiently and accurately match the right patient
with the right diagnosis/treatment, at the right time. Furthermore, over the past several years, a new paradigm–
precision medicine–has moved to the forefront of biomedical research and clinical practice. Precision medicine
has been defined as “an approach to disease treatment and prevention that seeks to maximize effectiveness by
taking into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.” Since its inception in 2018, the
mission of the PsycheMERGE network has been to advance precision psychiatry in a learning health care system
framework. This application, which was developed collaboratively by PsycheMERGE Network members,
represents an opportunity for profound advancement of both basic and translational research in precision
psychiatry. We propose extending our foundational efforts to now address barriers to scalability, utility of genomic
data, clinical application, and translation to clinical practice in a precision psychiatry paradigm. Specifically, Aim
1 creates a nation-wide federated transfer-learning platform for the development of generalizable and bias-aware
algorithms. Aim 2 integrates state-of-the-art methods to perform inclusive trans-ancestry genomic analysis of
biobank samples and further innovates by leveraging the breadth and depth of medical record data to discover
novel biology that can further inform precision psychiatry paradigms. Aim 3 addresses the application of
algorithms by focusing on two use cases including (a) differential diagnosis between bipolar disorder 1 and other
mood disorders, as well as (b) probabilistic treatment response to antidepressants for acute depressive
episodes. Lastly, Aim 4 uses mixed methods to assess the feasibility, utility, and attitudes towards precision
psychiatry tools. Our combined sample of clinical EHR data exceeds 29 million individuals and of those, nearly
2 million also have genetic data already available for analysis across the twelve sites included in this application.
A cross-cutting theme throughout the application is the intentional focus on equitable performance of algorithms,
innovative integration of social determinants of health, and inclusive methods for genomic analyses. The sites
included are also representative of many diverse communities across the United States including the East and
West Coasts, the South, and the Midwest. This application represents a major step towards equitable precision
psychiatry and brings the field closer to the goals outlined in the updated NIMH Strategic plan.",SUCCESS

Disorders of the inner ear manifest as an array of audiovestibular diseases and constitute a significant public
health burden, affecting millions of individuals and costing billions of dollars each year. As the population ages
worldwide, the disease prevalence is intensifying, necessitating immediate action to address this growing public
health issue. CT imaging of the inner ear is a central component of the diagnostic evaluation of patients
presenting with vestibular symptoms, hearing loss, autophony, and chronic otitis media. As a part of this
evaluation, accurate detection and characterization of potential labyrinthine dehiscence is imperative to
definitively rule in or rule out disease, inform patient counseling, guide shared clinical decision-making, quantify
the risk and potential outcome associated with surgical intervention, and further understand the natural history
of disease. Notably, current in vivo imaging techniques are unable to consistently decipher thin versus truly
dehiscent labyrinthine bone. Further, current CT imaging is not able to fully characterize dehiscence morphology
(shape, size, and surface area). As such, high-quality, high-resolution, artifact-free in vivo imaging is critically
needed for the reliable diagnosis and management of inner ear disorders such as superior semicircular canal
dehiscence syndrome and cholesteatomatous labyrinthine fistula.
To address this unmet clinical need, we propose to develop high-fidelity clinical imaging techniques for the inner
ear using photon counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms. Our team has been at the forefront of PCD-CT development and its clinical translation, and has an
established track record of strong multidisciplinary collaborative innovation in this space. Building upon our
successful prior work, we will harness the power of AI – in synergy with PCD-CT – to reduce image noise,
improve spatial resolution, and reduce radiation dose for CT imaging of the inner ear. We will develop and
validate these techniques with cadavers, and in vivo patient CT exams.
The innovation of our proposal lies in the synergy of PCD-CT and advanced AI algorithms for spatial resolution
improvement, noise and dose reduction, and a cadaver library of normal and labyrinthine thinning and
dehiscence specimens that will enable iterative protocol optimization of ultra-high-spatial-resolution inner ear
imaging. Without the proposed techniques, PCD-CT, while impressive, remains limited by noise, image artifacts,
and radiation dose. Further, under controlled conditions using cadaveric specimens, definitive evidence of the
impact of the developed techniques will be obtained. Successful completion of this proposal will have a significant
impact on patients with inner ear diseases, allowing high-fidelity imaging with improved diagnostic accuracy and
individualized patient management. In addition, the technical innovations for noise reduction, super-resolution,
and dose reduction developed in the proposal will benefit inner ear imaging tasks beyond dehiscence, including
direct visualization of the interscalar cochlear partition, and can be readily applied to the middle ear.",SUCCESS

""deep-learning CT reconstruction"" is explicit.","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Half of the man-made radiation exposure to the U.S. population can be attributed to CT. Thus, stakeholders
have invested heavily in the reduction of CT doses. Recently, CT Deep Learning Reconstruction or Denoising
(DLRD) techniques have become available that claim to enable dose reduction in CT, just as CT iterative
reconstruction (IR) claimed before it. Like DLRD, IR showed dramatic apparent increases in image quality by
reducing image noise. Subsequent clinical studies found that true dose reductions capabilities for IR were only
20-25% in soft tissues and organs. Greater dose reductions resulted in compromised signal detectability for
low-contrast lesions (e.g., liver metastases). Now, DLRD algorithms are being used in clinical practice and
appear to yield image quality superior to IR. But again, we are finding that excessive radiation dose reduction
can introduce new artifacts and compromise lesion detectability. Our overall objective is to develop and
validate methods that can quantitatively determine CT protocols that deliver the needed diagnostic
performance at the lowest patient dose for any scanner model or reconstruction algorithm.
 In our first two competitive award periods, we developed robust Channelized Hotelling model observers
(MOs) to quantify diagnostic performance using low contrast objects within a uniform phantom and validated
the work with large scale reader studies for both filtered back projection and IR images. We are deploying
these tools under EB028936 to allow robust dose optimization by CT users. However, there remain challenges.
First, low-contrast phantoms used with most MOs are too simple. Second, highly realistic lesion and noise
insertion tools require use of proprietary projection data and access to manufacturer software tools. Third, MOs
must be extended to work with DLRD methods and be generalizable to any scanner. The proposed work will
use patient image data, obviating the need for projection data, use our developed deep learning (DL)-MOs to
achieve a scalable solution for performance assessment, and be generalizable to any algorithm or scanner.
 The goal of this renewal application is to develop robust DL-MO tools to efficiently predict diagnostic
performance for images created with DLRD methods. We will accomplish this through three specific aims:
1. Develop and validate disease-insertion and low-dose-simulation tools for CT DLRD techniques.
2. Develop and validate DL-MO tools to quantify mean diagnostic performance for DLRD methods.
3. Extend DL-MO methods to estimate performance variations across readers.
 This work is the first to develop and use DL-MOs as accurate and efficient surrogates of human readers to
characterize task-specific performance of DLRD methods in CT using patient images. The resultant performance
assessment engine will facilitate training / testing of DL-based noise reduction algorithms and optimizing CT
protocols and doses. These significant capabilities will ensure that diagnostic performance and the lifesaving
diagnostic information obtained from CT are not compromised in DLRD-processed images.",SUCCESS

""deep learning derived... measures... using... CT images"" is explicit.","PROJECT SUMMARY
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of persons living with reduced physical function and with
aging-related chronic conditions. If we compare chronological age (calendar-based age) with biological age
(changes at the cellular, tissue, organ, and system levels), we can classify persons as aging faster
(accelerated aging) or slower (successful aging) than their peers. Methods have been developed to measure
biological age based on DNA methylation, telomere length, and blood biomarkers. However, such measures
may not accurately reflect organ- and tissue-level changes from aging. A multi-organ/tissue approach is
needed to identify comprehensive age-related structural changes before signs, symptoms, or clinical
diagnoses occur. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) has widespread use in the general population (35%
of adults ages 20-89 years in an 11-year period). Quantitative measures of the organs and tissues on
abdominal CT may predict organ-specific diseases, or in combination, may be used to calculate biological age
and predict the more global outcomes of hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that
deep learning (DL) models applied to abdominal CTs can quantify structural features of the organs and tissues
to identify persons with accelerated aging at high-risk for organ-specific disease, hospitalization, and death.
The Rochester Epidemiology Project record-linkage system provides access to a general population archive of
images for 423,081 abdominal CTs and to comprehensive medical record data among 181,187 adults (ages
20-89 years) between 2010-2020. Our team has already developed and validated DL tools to measure liver,
kidney, aorta, fat, muscle, and bone on abdominal CT images. We will leverage these resources to 1) establish
percentiles of abdominal CT biomarkers from both healthy and general population samples; 2) determine the
risk of organ-specific clinical disease by abdominal CT biomarkers in the general population; and 3) determine
the risk of hospitalization and death associated with abdominal CT measures in the general population. If
successful, application of DL tools to abdominal CT images will enrich the characterization of age-related
health risks without additional testing burden. Subclinical abdominal CT biomarkers may also inform the
biology of aging and early disease, improve disease classification, and provide opportunities for early
intervention.",SUCCESS

of the disease. My group recently established that inherited variants in 12 genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2,
CDH1, CHEK2, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53) predispose to breast cancer (1, 2), that
variants in all 12 genes increase risks of breast cancer in minority populations (3), and that variants in certain
genes predispose only to estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ATM and CHEK2) or ER negative and triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) (BARD1, RAD51C and RAD51D) (4-6). Despite these major advances, clinical application
of the information is still lacking. In addition, up to 50% of the familial risk of breast cancer remains unexplained.
Under this award we plan to address clinically relevant issues, including improved application of genetic testing
results for risk management of patients and improved selection of breast cancer therapy. In addition, we aim to
identify new breast cancer predisposition genes that account for the missing heritability. The proposed studies
are unified under a theme of advancing understanding of predisposition genetics. The studies are as follows:
A. Age-specific and population-specific cancer risk assessment for predisposition gene variants. Results from
hereditary multigene panel testing has limited clinical utility because only lifetime risk estimates of cancer by age
80 are available. Here we will estimate 5 and 10-year risks of breast cancer, so that patients can make decisions
about medical management. In addition, we have evidence that specific genes have much higher penetrance in
African Americans. We will determine the penetrance of predisposition gene variants using a large African
American cohort study in order to modify risk management guidelines for this population.
B. Functional characterization of predisposition gene variants. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)
identified by genetic testing remain a major problem for individuals receiving clinical genetic testing. We aim to
combine high-throughput functional analysis of VUS in ATM, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes with genetic data from
families in integrated models to determine the clinical relevance of many VUS alterations.
C. Therapeutic response for breast cancer predisposition genes. The responsiveness of breast tumors
associated with predisposition gene variants to standard or targeted therapy is only known for BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers. Here we aim to identify all patients with pathogenic variants in the commonly mutated
BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 genes from a series of neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic breast
cancer clinical trials and to assess response to therapy and outcome.
D. Identification of novel breast cancer predisposition alleles. The common and rare risk alleles for breast
cancer account for only 50% of the familial risk in the population. In an effort to identify the missing heritability
we will collaborate with Regeneron Inc. through our SIMPLEXO consortium to identify common and rare alleles
associated with breast cancer risk in 45,000 breast cancer patients.",SUCCESS

Although multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common blood cancer in Black/African American (AA) individuals,
AA patients have been significantly underrepresented in MM research studies and clinical trials. MM has one of
the most pronounced disparities in the incidence and mortality between AA and European American (EA)
patients. As MM research has largely focused on patients of European ancestry, it remains unknown whether
disparities in the incidence and outcomes of AA and EA patients are due to differences in healthcare access
and/or socioeconomic, environmental, or biological factors. Large-scale studies comparing variation of the MM
tumor, its tumor microenvironment (TME) and disease survival among AA patients and incorporating calculated
African ancestry are critically needed. Our long-term goal is to identify important factors contributing to the health
disparity in AA patients with MM. The overall objective of this proposal is to characterize the genetic variations
of the MM tumor, its TME, and the impact of this variation on disease survival in a large, well-powered study of
AA patients with MM. We hypothesize that AA patients have favorable MM tumor genetics but a greater
immunosenescent TME, which can affect response to therapy and overall survival. The following specific aims
will be evaluated: 1) Differentiate the genetic variations of MM tumors between newly diagnosed AA and EA
patients; 2) Analyze the MM tumor microenvironments of newly diagnosed AA and EA patients; and 3) Compare
the responses to treatment of MM tumors in newly diagnosed AA and EA patients. In specific aim 1, 1500 newly
diagnosed MM patients (480 AA and 1020 EA) from two independent cohorts will be used to determine the
frequency of risk-defining tumor genetic abnormalities, genome-wide genomic complexity, and mutation
signatures. Differences in disease survival will be compared in relation to these risk-defining genetic
abnormalities and the influence of race. In specific aim 2, 200 newly diagnosed MM patients (100 AA and 100
EA) from Mayo Clinic cohort will be used to analyze the TME signatures using RNAseq and validated using
CyTOF. Differences in disease survival will be compared in relation to these TME signatures and the influence
of race. In specific aim 3, 100 newly diagnosed MM patients (50 AA and 50 EA) from Mayo Clinic will be used to
evaluate tumor responses to therapeutic regimens using an ex vivo drug sensitivity platform. Genetic and
transcriptomic predictors of ex vivo drug response will be assessed, and top targets and novel agents will be
evaluated using human myeloma cell lines. This proposal is significant because understanding MM tumor
genetics and TME in AA patients will allow for improved treatment selection and prognostication in this
underserved population.",SUCCESS

This is a renewal of the NCI-supported Mayo Clinic SPORE in Hepatobiliary Cancers (HBC), with a foundation
built upon innovative translational science and utilizing state-of-the-art approaches to understand and treat liver
cancers; these are the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the country. The breadth of the projects spans
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and pediatric/young adult fibrolamellar (FLC).
Three unique translational projects promise significant steps forward, supported by three well-constructed and respon-
sive cores. Additionally, robust Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs continue to identify
and support talented HBC-investigators, many from underrepresented groups. Ongoing support from the Mayo
Foundation and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center benefit these components by enabling integrated
resources, skilled staff, and leadership guidance to ensure success. The approach remains comprehensive,
milestone focused, and patient centered. For example, the completion of former Project 3 has led to a novel first-in-
class compound that has advanced to clinical trial. Three projects have developed successfully into innovative renewal pro-
jects that utilize novel approaches of immunotherapeutics, computational biology, and chemical genomics. The translational
projects in this renewal proposal investigate HBC biology to enhance therapeutic response, building on recent,
promising clinical and preclinical advances, summarized below. Diagnostics and drug repurposing for FLC: Pro-
ject 1 demonstrates 1) differential therapeutic sensitivity of FLC but with 2) variability in patient responsiveness,
and now extends into a novel functional approach to precision medicine by 3) defining therapeutics that affect
FLC cell viability, while also 4) developing blood- and urine-based biomarkers for tumor burden. Targeting yes-

Imaging"" is a core computational task.","PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA and is
anticipated to become the second leading cause by 2030. Its characteristic desmoplastic stroma, constituting
60–70% of its volume, is one of the critical factors that contributes to the dismal outcomes. Fibroblast activation
protein (FAP)-expressing Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most important stromal
constituents because they play a fundamental role in the carcinogenesis, fibrosis, tumor growth, metastases,
and treatment resistance. FAP expression in PDA is an independent predictor of poor outcomes. Lack of
noninvasive tools to precisely profile CAF identity and function both temporally and spatially in vivo is a critical
barrier for translation of existing knowledge of the tumor microenvironment to address unmet clinical needs.
68Ga-FAP-inhibitor (FAPI)-46 has emerged as a PET radiotracer with optimal properties for FAP-targeted clinical
imaging and theranostics in PDA. These include low nanomolar affinity to FAP, near-complete internalization of
radioactivity bound to FAP, absence of physiologic uptake, rapid blood clearance and prolonged tumor retention,
and operational characteristics that offer tremendous flexibility to suit the clinical context, PET scanner profile,
and workflow for patients with PDA. Traditionally, long regulatory and reimbursement approval pathways coupled
with high costs of comparative studies have delayed clinical access to promising precision tools such as 68Ga-
FAPI-46 PET. Thus, for the clinical translation of a theranostic radiotracer such as 68Ga-FAPI-46, an academic-
industrial partnership (AIP) based on complementary strengths and a coherent clinical development strategy is
needed to reduce the risk and raise the likelihood of meeting FDA standards and consumer expectations. Our
AIP - Mayo Clinic and Sofie Biosciences (“SOFIE”) - will undertake a clinical investigation in compliance with
FDA standards to form the basis of a new drug application (NDA) with the goal to deliver a new capability to end
users, consistent with this FOA’s intent. Our hypothesis is that 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be an accurate technique
to detect and quantify CAFs and that metrics derived from 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be novel biomarkers in PDA.
In Aim 1, using immunophenotyping as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-FAPI-46
PET will be evaluated for the detection and quantification of CAFs in PDA, along with inter-reader and intra-
reader reliability, and the dynamic changes in 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET biomarkers in response to neoadjuvant
treatment. In Aim 2, 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET will be compared, correlated, and combined with other mechanistically
distinct investigations to improve pre-surgical staging and to predict post-surgical outcomes. Our AIP has the
potential to deliver a noninvasive molecular imaging assay that can provide greater insight into disease biology,
impact clinical practice, predict outcomes, potentiate existing therapeutics, and yield a pathway to novel
therapeutic approaches. Given the wide and evolving role of FAPI imaging and theranostics, our AIP has the
potential to scale our impact beyond PDA to other oncologic and non-oncologic applications.",SUCCESS

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the immunological paradox by which solid tumors first
metastasize via lymphatic channels into the immune-rich lymph node. During this process, immune
surveillance is disabled, ultimately allowing metastatic dissemination to the precise location where it should be
first eliminated—the tumor-draining, sentinel lymph node (SLN). While notably prognostic, it is clear the
metastatic status of the SLN alone is not sufficient in determining patient’s risk or relapse. Therefore,
understanding the mechanisms underlining this chronic process of tumor mediated regional
immunosuppression, commonly referred to as pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation in the SLN will lend
significant insights for developing improved prognostic and therapeutic tools to detect and reverse cancer
dissemination early in the natural history of metastatic progression. Our long term goal is to develop
therapeutic strategies capable of overcoming the immune compromise of the SLN PMN and thereby disrupt
the first stage of cancer metastasis. Therefore, the objective of the current work is to mechanistically
interrogate the process by which the subcellular component of the primary tumor lymphatic effluent directly
mediates PMN formation. The central hypothesis proposes that in solid tumors, subcellular mediators derived
from the primary tumor microenvironment actively traffic through the lymphatics and in a cargo-dependent
manner create a PMN in the tumor-draining SLN. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of
preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory; namely the discovery and characterization of
human lymphatic extracellular vesicles (L-EV) which have a demonstrated capacity to modulate
immune function. The rationale asserts that in elucidating the factors and signatures that define PMN
formation in the SLN, the knowledge gained will be significant as it will identify histopathologic biomarkers that
could aid in patient risk stratification beyond the presence of melanoma cells in the SLN. Guided by strong
preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) identify mechanisms whereby lymphatic
subcellular factors promote immune dysfunction in the pre-metastatic SLN beyond those already identified (i.e.
S100A9); 2) evaluate the prognostic utility of these immune-modulating factors in predicting risk of recurrence
by considering the comprehensive, interactive cellular landscape that defines the immunologically
compromised SLN. The approach is innovative as it will use a mechanism-driven model to identify subcellular
factors from a previously uncharacterized biological fluid, human lymph (Aim 1), complemented by a novel,
multiplexed biomarker imaging approach in order to survey the SLN immunological landscape in a quantitative
and spatially preserved manner to ultimately translate predictive features into clinically amenable platforms
(Aim 2). Such findings will result in a refined definition of early-stage patients at risk of relapse and in need of
earlier interventions.",SUCCESS

The study of African genomes is an urgent, critical need, not only to promote equity but also as a scientific
imperative. Prior studies have included mostly individuals from Western, Central, or Southern Africa, and a
major gap is the lack of cohorts from East Africa, who likely have unique demographic history, allele frequency
spectrum and linkage disequilibrium patterns. The Somalis are a distinct East African population group who
have not been part of genomic medicine research initiatives.
Due to political instability, many Somalis emigrated to the United States, with the largest number living in
Southeast Minnesota. Using a community based participatory research framework to guide efforts, we
engaged with the Somali community including tribal elders, imams, and healthcare workers, as well as
representative community-based organizations (e.g., Somali Health Advisory Committee, Pamoja Women) and
noted the community’s enthusiasm to engage in genomic medicine research. Our proposed research will
enable a research partnership with an underserved population of East African origin to establish a genomic
medicine research program in this understudied community. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1.
(a) Expand a community based participatory genomic medicine research effort in the Somali community of
Southeast Minnesota. We will be guided by a Community Advisory Board with diverse representation; (b)
Create a biobank of 1000 Somali individuals that includes plasma, DNA, and RNA. Clinical variables and social
determinants of health will be obtained from the electronic health record and surveys. Aim 2. (a) Perform
population genetics analyses of whole genome sequencing (30x) data, to investigate the demographic history
of the Somali population. We will use a graph genome reference based on African sequences from the
Pangenome Consortium, instead of the linear GRCh38, for more accurate variant calling; (b) Use population
genetics data to inform construction of polygenic scores for biologically relevant quantitative traits, starting with
lipid levels, height, and body mass index. Aim 3. (a) Identify actionable variants in medically relevant genes
(ACMG Secondary Findings v3.0) as well as select pharmacogenomic variants; (b) Return actionable results
based on input from the community and participant choice and assess near term outcomes.
By conducting research in a unique and understudied racial/ethnic group, the proposed work will extend our
knowledge of African genomes, help lessen disparities in genomic medicine and provide novel insights that are
relevant to diverse populations.",SUCCESS

Genome Wide Association Study"" (GWAS) is a classic computational genomics task.","Abstract/Project Summary
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly lethal cancer that arises from the bile ducts and is often diagnosed at
an advanced stage with very poor prognosis. Factors associated with development of CCA include
inflammatory conditions of the bile ducts such as congenital cysts, gallstones, primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), chronic hepatitis from viral and other causes, and occupational exposure to toxins such as the organic
solvents dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloropropane. In parts of Asia, liver fluke infestations of the bile ducts are
a major risk factor. However, the majority of patients who develop CCA worldwide have no known major risk
factor. Based on epidemiologic studies, it appears that CCA risk is due to a combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic susceptibility loci for
different cancer types, allowing development of risk models that can allow determination of an individual’s risk
of cancer. GWAS have also provided valuable information on the biological and molecular pathways that
contribute to risk of different cancers, allowing improved understanding of cancer development and progress in
cancer prevention and treatment. Because CCA is a relatively less common cancer, it has been difficult to study
large numbers of CCA patients and there have been no large CCA GWAS studies published, either for patients
with de novo CCA or for CCA developing in patients with PSC. Although PSC patients are up to 150 times
more likely to develop CCA than the general population, only 10-20% of PSC patients will progress to CCA.
Variation in the risk of CCA among PSC patients may be caused by a complex interplay between genetic and
environmental factors. Several studies indicate PSC has a strong genetic component; however, the impact of
genetic factors in PSC-related CCA development is yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that different host
genetic variants are associated with CCA risk in de novo versus PSC-associated CCA cases. We have
developed a large multi-institutional and multi-national collaboration to identify gene variants associated with
CCA. The goal of this study is to use high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of genomic
DNA from CCA patients and controls. In a first phase of the study, we have genotyped DNA from 2829 CCA
patients, including 2412 of European and 417 of Asian descent. Of the European descent cases, 197 were
PSC-associated. Comparing the results with controls from the PLCO cohort, we identified a variant in the HLA
region on chromosome 6 that reached genome wide significance. A number of additional regions showed
suggestive results. We now propose an expansion of this discovery phase to acquire, genotype and sequence
DNA from an additional 7,267 CCA patients to confirm the validity of these suggestive results. We are also
expanding recruitment efforts to enrich the cohort in samples from non-European patients. We will use
sophisticated statistical genetic methods to analyze the results from the multi-ethnic cohort. Whole exome
sequencing will also be used to identify rare variants associated with CCA.",SUCCESS

Knowledge about lupus is biased towards the severe end of the disease spectrum due to difficulty assembling
population-based cohorts of persons with lupus. An urgent need to expand the basic epidemiologic
understanding of cutaneous and systemic lupus in four content areas (i.e., natural history, treatment, health
care access, and disparities) was identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our project
addresses these needs using the unique research infrastructure of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP),
which contains longitudinal data on residents of a 27-county region in Minnesota and Wisconsin. We have
assembled population-based cohorts comprised of persons with prevalent and incidence systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) matched to general population comparators
without SLE/CLE by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and county of residence. These cohorts comprise the Lupus
Midwest Network (LUMEN). Through the REP infrastructure, LUMEN follows individuals regardless of
insurance status and encompasses the full spectrum of care, from primary care clinics to tertiary specialty
care, and maintains an electronic index of diagnoses and procedures, including all inpatient and outpatient
encounters, laboratory measures, and drug prescription data. In this competitive renewal of a highly successful
grant investigating multimorbidity in SLE and CLE, opioid pain therapy, and healthcare access and gaps, our
team of researchers and clinicians with decades of experience conducting population-based research will now
focus on new research questions designed to have a high public health impact and to leap forward in our
understanding of the natural history, treatment, healthcare access, and disparities across the full spectrum of
CLE and SLE. Using the LUMEN population-based cohorts, we aim to 1) determine the contributions of lupus
nephritis (LN) and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) to the excess mortality and unplanned healthcare
utilization (i.e., emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among patients with SLE; 2) determine the
contribution of LN to the excess risk of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke), infections,
and osteoporosis among patients with SLE; 3) determine access to SLE-specific screening services and
patterns of glucocorticoid use by social determinants of health, age, sex, and race/ethnicity; and 4) determine
the transition rates over time and risk factors for transition from CLE to SLE over four decades to test the
hypothesis that a) most transitions from CLE to SLE occur within five years of the CLE diagnosis, and b) oral
contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone use increase the risk of transitioning from CLE to SLE. These
projects will inform the individualized prognostication of SLE in clearly defined disease phenotypes and inform
interventions to optimize patient care, prevent or reduce adverse outcomes in patients with lupus, and will
identify a window of opportunity in CLE for therapeutic interventions to prevent the transition to SLE.",SUCCESS

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) with core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is recognized
as the prodromal stage of DLB (MCI-LB). Patients with MCI-LB frequently progress to DLB, but a subset may
have a range of additional AD pathology. Rapid advances in the development of protein-specific disease-
modifying therapies highlight a critical need for biomarkers in MCI-LB, because clinical trials will need to be
sufficiently powered to detect changes in disease progression during the prodromal phase, when the disease-
modifying therapies would be most effective. During the initial cycle of this project, we determined the cross-
sectional and longitudinal imaging biomarkers of DLB with pathologic confirmation. The current cycle of the
U01 project is designed to identify cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-modal biomarkers of prodromal DLB in
MCI-LB, and prepare for protein-specific disease-modifying clinical trials that will need these biomarkers for
selection of participants and to track outcomes in MCI-LB. The rationale for a multi-modal biomarker approach
stems from the multi-factorial and co-existing LBD and AD pathology in DLB and similarly in MCI-LB. We will
determine the cross-sectional and longitudinal PET, SPECT, MRI, and polysomnogram (PSG) biomarkers of
MCI-LB compared to cognitively unimpaired controls. We will also determine whether age, sex as a biological
variable, APOE ε4 status, and cerebrovascular disease lesions on MRI modulate these differences. In a pilot
analysis, we will compare protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and real-time quaking-induced
conversion (RT-QuIC) assays for α-synuclein in CSF for differentiating MCI-LB from controls. Finally, we will
correlate our findings with pathologic outcomes. Inclusion of MCI-LB patients in the current cycle will be based
on the presence of one or more core clinical features of DLB and not on biomarker findings. This will provide
the opportunity to validate the use of proposed and novel biomarkers in the diagnosis of MCI-LB and to
determine which biomarkers predict progression from MCI-LB to DLB. All samples, clinical, imaging, and
autopsy data from MCI-LB cases and controls will be collected and shared according to the Parkinson's

incurable. Due to its impaired immune response, CLL has high number of morbidity and mortality
complications including increase risk of infections and second cancers. Therefore, identifying individuals who
are at markedly higher risk of developing this disease may enable future prevention strategies. Monoclonal B-
cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is the precursor state to CLL. The prevalence of MBL increases with age and is
found in almost a third of Caucasians older than 60 years. The prevalence of MBL in African Americans (AA)
is not well established. Although all individuals with CLL pass through the MBL precursor state, the reason
why some individuals with MBL progress to CLL yet many do not is unclear. Therefore, there is a need to
identify biomarkers that differentiate those MBL who will progress versus those who will remain asymptomatic.
The overall goal of this application is to address this knowledge gap by evaluating genetic and epigenetic
factors associated with risk of progression to CLL among an established cohort of 1,729 Caucasian individuals
with MBL. Importantly there is a widening equity gap with respect to our understanding of MBL and progression
to CLL in AA populations. Motivated by this, we will also take the initial steps to begin reducing this gap by
developing an MBL cohort of AA individuals through screening of 4,000 AAs and then undertake important
preliminary work of evaluating the genetic and epigenetic factors in our new AA MBL cohort. In Aim 1 we will
analyze the polygenetic risk score (PRS) comprised of a weighted average of 41 inherited single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been previously identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS)
of CLL with risk of progression to CLL. In Aim 2 we will perform deep targeted sequencing of 59 putative CLL
driver genes to investigate if individual genes with high-impact mutations or the aggregate number of mutated
genes leads to an increased risk of progression from MBL to CLL. Finally, in Aim 3 we will evaluate whether
methylation signatures that classify MBL individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk predict progression
to CLL. At the completion of this application, we will have identified three complementary yet independent
genetic and epigenetic factors that we hypothesize will be strong predictors of progression to CLL among a
cohort of Caucasian MBLs. Our preliminary data support our hypotheses. We have the largest cohort of
individuals with MBL collected in US, putting us in an unsurpassed situation to prospectively evaluate the effect
of known CLL risk factors at the precancer phase. Our integrative predictive model of all three biomarkers may
change current practice guidelines and ultimately improve quality of life by reducing anxiety and distress for
individuals in pre-malignant phase. Finally, because little is known about the generalizability of these genetic
and epigenetic factors in AA, we enhanced the significance of our application by taking the initial and vital
steps to build resources to begin the explorations of these genetic and epigenetic factors in AA individuals.",SUCCESS

We propose to improve risk assessment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a major lethal cancer

Clinic datasets of PDAC cases recruited since 2002 and primary care controls in the Mayo Clinic Biobank with
recently completed whole exome sequencing (WES) by Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) to first assess the
limited number of existing published models. We will then construct our eMRS with these data and perform
independent validation using the UK Biobank. We will test the value of the model in a dataset of at-risk first-
degree relatives (FDRs) of Mayo Clinic PDAC patients. Our new eMRS for PDAC will for the first time
comprehensively accommodate inherited cancer syndrome pathogenic variants to stratify risk of PDAC in
identically processed sequencing and informatics workflows. The study team includes leaders in gene
identification and genetic epidemiology of PDAC, having led the GWAS that identified the risk SNPs that will be

one family dataset with accompanying epidemiologic and disease covariates, our specific aims are: (1) To use
uniquely coordinated datasets on Mayo Clinic PDAC cases and Mayo Biobank controls to validate published
polygenic risk score (PRS) and MRS models. We will assemble and analyze Mayo Clinic’s 4,552 prospectively
recruited cases and 53,229 controls to evaluate the heretofore unvalidated models. (2) To build and validate a
novel, enhanced eMRS for PDAC that incorporates cancer germline pathogenic variants. (2a) We will use the
datasets built for cases and controls in Aim 1 and include additional epidemiologic risk factors and germline
pathogenic variant status for hereditary cancer genes, which have not been previously available in public
datasets. (2b) We will validate our new eMRS with an independent dataset of genotype and risk factor data
extracted from 2,371 PDAC cases and the remaining 497,629 non-PDAC UK Biobank participants whose
germline DNA will have also been sequenced by RGC. (3) To determine the extent that PRS, MRS or eMRS
can further refine PDAC risk in first degree relatives of PDAC cases. We will compare standardized incidence
ratios (SIRs) in a dataset of personal cancer histories of 23,739 relatives assembled from Mayo Clinic PDAC
cases’ family history questionnaires to quantify and assess impact. This project will result in several useful
genetic risk stratification models to provide more precise risk assessment for PDAC. The results are
anticipated to have a translational impact on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and early detection of PDAC

offered minimally invasive surveillance or other options for early-stage detection and prevention.",SUCCESS

Irritable bowel syndrome is a globally prevalent disorder (~11%) characterized by an alteration in stool
form/frequency and abdominal pain one or more days per week. Abdominal pain in IBS, like other forms of
visceral pain, is often diffuse and poorly localized, making it difficult to delineate the site of pathology, and as a
result there are few therapeutic options. Gut microbial products have been shown to be important luminal signals
for abdominal pain, but these studies have largely focused on the colon. We recently found that small intestinal
microbial composition is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like abdominal pain, but the mechanisms
underlying the role of small intestinal microbiota/microbial products in the pathophysiology of abdominal pain
remains a critical knowledge gap. To address this gap, we will elucidate the sensory innervation of the proximal
small intestine and identify the cellular and molecular pathways by which the small intestine detects and
transduces luminal microbial signals that contribute to visceral hypersensitivity. In our extensive preliminary
studies, we established a dedicated model to study the physiologic effects of human small intestinal microbiome
in germ free (GF) mice, metabolite effects on isolated DRGs and epithelial cells, and a novel ex vivo spinal cord-
small intestine preparation to study the transmission of luminal signals to the spinal cord via luminal metabolite
signaling through (1) EC cells, that are epithelial cells which signal to neurons via serotonin, a neurotransmitter
in the gut that modulates visceral pain, and (2) sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), the first-order
afferent neurons of pain pathways. Using these models, we identified distinct bacteria and bacterial metabolites
that activate EC cells and thoracic DRG neurons. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that small
intestinal bacterial products contribute to visceral hypersensitivity by activating small intestine sensory afferents
directly and through neuro-epithelial connections by activating EC cells. We will address the hypothesis in two

cells and DRG neurons, and in Specific Aim 2, we will determine the sensory transduction pathways involved
in responding to distinct microbial products. These studies will be the first to provide a functional and molecular
characterization of sensory neurons in the DRG that innervate the small intestine, determine which
subpopulations are activated and/or sensitized by microbial products in the lumen, and test whether EC cells are
involved in the sensory transduction pathway. Our findings will allow the development of novel microbial
therapies for abdominal pain that target distinct microbial pathways in the small intestine.",SUCCESS

Alcohol withdrawal is a critical component of development and persistence of addiction to alcohol and a cause
for significant morbidity and mortality in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Introduction of
benzodiazepines resulted in reduced severity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), and decreased mortality
and frequency of complications. While research suggests involvement of certain neurotransmitter systems in
the neurobiology of AWS, genetic markers associated with predisposition to AWS and its treatment response
remain unknown. We therefore propose to perform comprehensive genetic analyses, including genome-wide
association studies (GWASs), to identify genetic markers of AWS risk and response to benzodiazepine
treatment of AWS. The proposed analyses will constitute the largest GWAS of AWS to date, with a sample
size of AUD subjects 10 times larger than the only previously published AWS GWAS, and the first GWAS of
benzodiazepine response. We will also investigate sex differences in genetic effects on AWS and
response to its treatment. Our study will involve advanced analyses, including assessment of SNP-based
heritability of AWS along with gene and pathway-level analyses (including drug-target enrichment) and
fine-mapping to detect relevant genetic effects. We will also use polygenic risk scores to determine if
genetic load for AUD-related traits is associated with AWS. The proposed study is aligned with NIAAA policy,
which states that GWAS is “the preferred approach for the identification of and the confirmation of genes that
harbor variants that contribute to AUD and related phenotypes, since results from these studies will likely
provide potential insights into translational studies and new therapeutic targets”. The proposed research also
supports NIH efforts to increase awareness and attention to sex and gender in research. Our preliminary data
and power calculations demonstrate that analysis of available data is expected to identify common genetic
variants associated with AWS. Discovery of genetic variants that impact the risk of AWS will generate
knowledge on its neurobiology and ultimately contribute to the development of tools for the
identification of patients at risk and selection of treatment options based on an understanding of inter-
individual differences in sensitivity to this central component of AUD. This line of research may also
contribute to development of new AUD treatment approaches aimed to restore physiological
dysfunction associated with those genetic variants.",SUCCESS

We propose to create a multidisciplinary Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical Proteomics with the overarching goal

unique alliance comprising of two teams within the Mayo Clinic umbrella and one team at Brigham Young
University. This team of physicians and scientists at Mayo Clinic with expertise in multiple myeloma
diagnosis, treatment, clinical trials and basic research as well as technologies such as mass
spectrometry, genomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics and clinical assay development will be joined
by a world expert in novel instrument/platform development at Brigham Young University to create a
unique center. Multiple myeloma is a complex disease with several distinct cytogenetic subtypes. A recently
developed class of drugs designated immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) has become a mainstay of
treatment of multiple myeloma although relapses among patients is high mainly due to drug resistance. The
primary target of IMiDs is cereblon (CRBN), which is absolutely required for its anti-cancer and immune activity.
IMiDs activate the enzymatic activity of the CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex leading to ubiquitylation and
degradation of transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3, thereby regulating tumor survival and immune response
through downregulation of IRF4 and MYC. For the preclinical arm, our interdisciplinary team will undertake
discovery studies involving comprehensive proteogenomic characterization (proteome, phosphoproteome,
ubiquitylome, genome, transcriptome) of multiple myeloma models (genetically engineered cell lines, humanized
mouse models and patient samples) to identify molecular markers of IMiD resistance. Given the centrality of
CRBN-mediated pathways in IMiD resistance, we will jumpstart our targeted proteomics efforts by
focusing on developing targeted assays for CRBN and its downstream effectors. In parallel, we anticipate
identifying additional candidate proteins through our discovery studies, for which targeted assays will also be
developed. Finally, Dr. Vincent Rajkumar, a co-investigator on this proposal, will provide access to samples from
three NCI-sponsored clinical trials specifically designed to look at effects of IMiDs enabling validation of
candidates through a targeted approach. By incorporating continuous development of multiple technology
platforms including CyTOF, we will ensure that we maintain agility over the duration of the proposal.
With an established advanced infrastructure, personnel experienced in the development of CAP/CLIA assays,
dedicated instrumentation, high analytical capacity and existing pipelines for QC, data handling and
bioinformatics, the proposed Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical Proteomics is poised for success to discover and
validate proteomic markers of IMiD resistance in multiple myeloma.",SUCCESS

principal investigators (PIs) identified that certain BC predisposition genes (ATM, CHEK2 and PALB2) were
associated mainly with the risk of ER+ BC. The Pis will assess pathogenic variants in ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2,
PALB2 and determine a) age-related risks, the risks of contralateral BC and second cancers (ovarian,
colorectal, pancreatic etc.), b) the prognostic effects of these PV and c) the clinical relevance of variants of
uncertain significance in ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2. Project 2: “Improving the endocrine management of
premenopausal ER+/HER2- BC” brings forward a new ER-targeting drug, Z-endoxifen (ENDX), for
premenopausal ER+ BC based on new data that ENDX dually targets both ERα and PKCβ1, with potent
protein downregulation of ERα, Cyclin D1, and E2F1. This dual targeting is not only unique to ENDX, but at
the dosing proposed in the clinical trial, ENDX is able to completely block the stimulatory effects of
premenopausal levels of estrogen. Project 3: “Development of a novel multi-antigen BC prevention vaccine
for women with premalignant disease” is based on pioneering work of Mayo investigators to develop a novel
vaccine that targets six antigens collectively expressed by all BC subtypes. The work in this project will provide
critical information that will allow the investigators to a) understand the expression of target antigens during
progression from normal breast tissue to BC; and, b) in the phase I study, evaluate blood and breast tissue
biomarkers of immune response. Successful completion of this project will establish the parameters for a phase III
clinical trial of the vaccine for BC prevention in women with benign breast disease (BBD), with the enormous
potential to drive significant reductions in overall BC incidence and mortality. These research projects are
supported by three highly interactive cores: Core A: Administrative Core, Core B: Biospecimen and Pathology
Core, and Core C: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Patient Registry Core. A Developmental Research
Program will continue to identify and develop research projects that hold the greatest promise to advance to
full SPORE projects, and a Career Enhancement Program will continue to identify and support faculty
investigators in BC translational research that have the greatest potential to become future SPORE leaders.
The investigators, cores, and the research programs in the SPORE are all integrated in the Mayo Clinic Cancer
Center. Collectively, our SPORE will make discoveries and translate them into the clinic for the benefit of
women with, or at risk of BC.",SUCCESS

The Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) has been operating at the Mayo Clinic Rochester
(MCR) and Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) since 1990. The theme of the current cycle of the ADRC is Multiple
Etiology Dementias. We recruit and follow participants on the Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar
degeneration (FTLD), Lewy body disorders (LBD) and vascular cognitive impairment dementia (VCID) spectra
to study the roles of multiple pathologic processes functioning to impact cognition in aging. We will be evaluating
the social and structural determinants of health in African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino communities at
MCF and rural residents at MCR to determine the manner in which the multiple pathologic processes evolve in
these communities. Our team has secured several grants in AD, FTLD, LBD and VCID to allow us to leverage
the resources of the ADRC against these projects to advance our knowledge. New cores in this ADRC
application include the Genomics Core that will study the role of multi-omic aspects of various
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) disorders, and a Digital Innovation Core that will
combine aspects of artificial intelligence neuroimaging, gait, speech/language and remote cognitive
assessments to help diagnose and evaluate the longitudinal outcome of neurodegenerative and CVD disorders.
The Biomarker Core will evaluate several plasma assays and platforms to determine the utility of these plasma
markers in predicting the underlying pathologies, assisting in the biological aspects of the diagnosis and following
treatments of these disorders. The Neuroimaging Core will continue to unify imaging protocols across
modalities between MCR and MCF as well as move the field forward with defacing MRI and PET images to
maximize research participant privacy. Our Neuropathology Core has been at the forefront of developing
neuropathology criteria and serves the vital function of confirming the multiple etiological nature of most
degenerative/CVD conditions. The Data Management and Statistical Core will continue to lead the field in
electronic data capture for our Center enabling the robust sharing of data. The Research Education
Component has been successful at training the next generation of investigators from underserved populations
and will expand these efforts. The Mayo Clinic ADRC will continue to be a leader in sharing images, data and
biospecimens with the other ADRC’s and the broader research community. The unique focus of the Mayo Clinic
ADRC involving the combinations of most of the major neurodegenerative and CVD disorders will advance the
field for refining diagnoses leading to the development of therapies.",SUCCESS

Acamprosate and naltrexone are major medications used in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
However, response to treatment with these drugs is variable, with only ~50% of patients achieving optimal
outcomes. As a result, it would be important to identify molecular mechanisms underlying individual variation in
AUD drug treatment outcomes. That information could potentially facilitate the development of individualized
AUD pharmacotherapy regimens as well as the development of novel AUD therapeutic agents. During the
current funding cycle, we performed a series of “Pharmaco-Omic” studies designed to identify biomarkers
associated with acamprosate response for AUD patients enrolled in our Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized
Treatment of Alcohol Dependence (CITA) clinical trial—one of the largest acamprosate AUD clinical trials
and one for which we have generated a series of multiple omics datasets. Using those data, we identified
novel biomarkers associated with variation in acamprosate treatment outcomes. Those biomarkers included, for
example, the FNDC4 gene and a series of other genes—genes which we now propose to study further by
performing functional studies of the AUD biomarkers that we have already identified and to extend those studies
to include a series of protein biomarkers for both AUD drug response and AUD pathophysiology. Finally, we
will also expand our studies to include the application of iPSC-derived brain organoids from both our
AUD patients and control subjects to make it possible to identify genes and biological pathways that
contribute to acamprosate and naltrexone treatment response. In summary, the studies proposed in this
application represent a systematic attempt to identify and study molecular mechanisms underlying and
associated with variation in AUD drug treatment response phenotypes and AUD clinical outcomes in
response to drug therapy. Our use of “multiple omics” to study samples from AUD patients treated with these
drugs, followed by “functional omic” studies of those samples and concluding with the generation and study of
patient-derived brain organoids generated from the same patients make this series of studies truly unique
and—based on our preliminary data—highly promising for the identification of novel candidate genes and
pathways. The results of the proposed studies would represent a significant step toward greater understanding
of the biology of acamprosate and naltrexone treatment response in AUD, potentially leading to the development
of better and more effective AUD drug therapy, an outcome that would represent a significant advance in the
treatment of this disorder.",SUCCESS

screening strategy, with concomitant poor survival rates. Detection of PDAC at an early stage positively impacts
survival, and currently screening in eligible high-risk individuals (HRIs) defined by family history and germline
mutation status is considered best practice. The overall goal of this proposal is to use knowledge gained during
the last grant period to considerably enhance our ability to develop and validate the diagnostic performance of
new blood protein and methylated DNA (MDM) biomarkers for early detection of PDAC, using prospective
specimen collection and retrospective blinded evaluation (PRoBE) compliant methods. We hypothesize that a
combination of proteins, MDMs, and CA19-9 will accurately identify early stage PDAC in HRIs. We will assess
the performance characteristics of our approaches in early stage and pre-diagnostic phase of PDAC and identify
approaches that are optimized for clinical translation as an early detection tool using HRIs. For over two decades,
Mayo Clinic’s prospective biospecimen resources have accrued, using standardized high-quality procedures,
well-annotated biospecimens from thousands of PDAC patients including those with germline mutations in
pancreas cancer susceptibility genes, high risk members in familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, patients with
high-risk pancreatic conditions, and healthy controls. We have also launched the PCDC Signature Protocols at
our center. Among those at risk with biospecimens who we have followed longitudinally over two decades,
incident PDAC cases have developed, enabling us to utilize novel approaches to address the challenges and
better design PRoBE phase 3 studies. Based on our findings in the last grant period, we now focus on tailoring
samples for PRoBE phase 2 studies and characterizing performance to improve phase 3 studies. Our approach
will allow us to assess, for example, variability in biomarker expression for intended use HRI settings, and
temporality of biomarker expression to improve the ability to detect early onset PDAC. Our Specific Aims are to:
1) Accrue formal biospecimen sets from blood sample products and pancreatic cyst fluid suitable for PCDC
biomarker studies; 2) Leverage our past knowledge and experience to develop new biomarker panels using
tailored phase 2 designs and incorporating covariates to refine detection (age, sex, race, smoking, personal
history of diabetes mellitus, symptoms at diagnosis) to optimize detection; and 3) Evaluate needed performance
parameters that will inform the design of a successful phase 3 study for PDAC in a surveillance setting of HRIs.
Our multidisciplinary team is committed to continue its leadership and contribution to the PCDC organization to
advance the early detection of pancreatic cancer. Our project leverages existing infrastructures and biospecimen
banks of pancreatic cancer and other pancreatic diseases at Mayo Clinic and University of Pennsylvania, and it
will extend new prospective collections of blood and pancreatic cyst fluid from patients, contributing to PCDC
Signature Protocol cohorts and a PCDC central biorepository.",SUCCESS

Imaging Technique"" is a computational/signal processing task.","Abstract/Summary
PAD is characterized by impaired blood flow to the lower extremities, causing claudication and exercise
intolerance. Up to now, assessment of PAD is mainly performed by determination of stenosis or occlusion in
the large arteries and does not focus on microcirculation. Impaired arteriolar endothelial function,
microvascular responsiveness to specific stimuli in patients with PAD may play a central role in disease
development and progression. The impaired microvascular reactivity can be assessed by hyperemic
response to contraction and cuff occlusion as well as in response to submaximal exercise. Therefore, imaging
microvascular flow reactivity at various scales using methods that are safe, noninvasive, reliably quantitative,
and low-cost through application of already widely available technology is critically important for early
diagnosis and management of PAD. Here, we propose a novel contrast-free ultrasound pressure-based
method equipped with novel quantitative metrics that involves estimation of blood flow signals in the calf
muscle through processing ultrasound data frames by means of coherent ensemble selection, clutter filtering
using singular value decomposition, and background noise equalization, followed by quantitative analysis of
the flow variations in response to external pressure and submaximal exercise. Our vision is to complement
US with additional quantitative information of microvascular flow imaging that is relevant to disease
progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a new noninvasive tool for early diagnosis of PAD. A
secondary gain from such an imaging method will be monitoring the disease progression and the response
to interventional treatment in PAD patients. The proposed contrast-free ultrasound-based technique is named
Angio Flow Reactivity Analysis (AFRA). An advantage of this technique is that it does not require the use of
contrast agents to produce high-resolution images of the microvasculature flow. The project includes 2
specific aims: Specific Aim 1- Determine the efficacy of the new contrast-free US-based method, AFRA, for
assessment of PAD in patient volunteers with symptoms of claudication or atypical leg syndrome and
correlate the results with ABI and CTA. Specific Aim #2- Determine the efficacy of the proposed contrast-free
US-based method, AFRA, for assessment of disease progression and monitoring the response to
interventional treatment in patients diagnosed with PAD and correlate and the results with ABI and CTA. This
proposal is the result of collaboration among several experts in the field and benefits from the world-class
clinical researchers and facilities at Mayo Clinic. The overall project aims to develop a new contrast-free
ultrasound tool for evaluating microvascular flow changes in the lower leg of patients at risk for PAD, a
disease that leads to common disabilities, amputation, and major cardiovascular events. Successful
completion of this research will open the door for a new technology for this group of patients in the clinic.",SUCCESS

System"" implies real-time signal processing and software engineering.","Project Summary:
High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection
area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that
HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including
eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of
a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones.
Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar
waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological
pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients
consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped
HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown.
As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an
implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into
closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured
with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be
utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an
acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing
stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with
the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the
second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites
associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop
stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples
and fast ripples.
If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation
at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography
and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring.
If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our
methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting.

Severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur in up to ~60% of melanoma patients treated
with combination (anti-PD1 / anti-CTLA4) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and cause treatment-
related morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology underlying severe irAE development
remains unclear and there is no way in clinical practice to predict who will develop severe toxicities
and who will not. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that clonally diverse activated CD4
memory T cells, and more specifically CXCR5–PD1hi peripheral helper T (Tph) cells, specifically
underpin ICI-mediated toxicity in melanoma patients. To address this hypothesis, we will perform flow
cytometry, CyTOF, scRNA-seq, scV(D)J-seq and immunoSEQ® to broadly assess T and B cell states
in peripheral blood to 1) determine whether Tph levels in pretreatment blood are predictive of severe
irAE development in melanoma patients treated with combination immunotherapy (Aim 1), and 2)
determine whether Tph clonotypes preferentially expand in on-treatment blood and are enriched in
irAE skin lesions during combination immunotherapy in patients who develop severe toxicity (Aim 2).
While the prediction of severe irAEs from peripheral blood will be important clinically, patients who
experience some degree of toxicity have also been shown to have better durable immunotherapy
response rates. Therefore, it will be challenging to make clinical decisions regarding immunotherapy
without also considering the probability of durable response. We will thus utilize cell-free DNA
methylation sequencing to predict 1) immunotherapy toxicity and 2) durable immunotherapy response
concurrently from pre-treatment plasma using both cell-state signatures and an agnostic machine
learning approach, which we will validate in held-out cohorts (Aim 3). By doing so, we will lay the
foundation for future clinical trials where immunotherapy decision-making is guided by the
risk versus benefit of combination immunotherapy using the liquid biopsy biomarkers defined
here. In summary, this study will reveal determinants of irAE development which will form the basis
for liquid biopsy technology to predict both immunotherapy response and toxicity to make treatment
safer and more personalized in the future.",SUCCESS

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is a benign plasma cell disorder, common in
the population (3-5% ≥50 years) and characterized by an asymptomatic clonal plasma cell expansion.
Although MGUS precedes multiple myeloma (MM) with progression rates of 1% per year, most (>75%) MGUS
never progress. MGUS is also associated with increased risk of infection, fracture, osteoporosis, renal
impairment, and thrombosis, with resultant morbidity and mortality. Few risk factors are identified for either the
development of MGUS or MGUS progression to MM, with African American (AA) ancestry being one of the
strongest. Identifying individuals who are more likely to progress is important given that individuals
with MGUS who are closely monitored prior to development of MM have better outcomes. Prior work
identified genetic variations associated with MM through family studies and, more recently, through genome
wide association studies (GWAS). However, no well-powered genetic epidemiology studies of MGUS have
been performed, particularly in AAs; and to our knowledge, none have investigated whether detection of
genetic variation improves the identification of high-risk MGUS, including those that progress to MM.
Therefore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation of genetic susceptibility to MGUS (Aim 1) and MGUS
progression to MM (Aim 2) using established epidemiologic and genomic studies among European Americans
(EA). Given the racial predisposition for MGUS and MM among AAs, for the first time, we propose to evaluate
the known MM susceptibility variants and novel variants identified in Aims 1-2 in AAs (Aim 3). Using both
GWAS and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), we will answer the questions: (1) What are the
genetic variations and genes predisposing to MGUS (Aim 1)? (2) How do these compare to genetic
predisposition associated with progression from MGUS to MM (Aim 2)? (3) Do these identified genetic factors
(and consequent polygenic risk scores, PRS) differentiate between MGUS patients that do and do not progress
to active MM (Aim 2)? and finally, (4) Are these genetic factors for MGUS risk and progression similar across
populations of EA and AA ancestries (Aim 3)? We will utilize established EA and AA studies of MGUS and
MGUS progression to MM (MM vs. MGUS), the majority with GWAS, to allow for discovery and validation. We
will also leverage genomic data, including RNA-sequencing of both whole blood (peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, PBMCs) and sorted CD138+ bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) from MGUS patients to inform gene
expression for the TWAS. Further, we will perform functional characterization of the new genes or variants
validated in both EA and AA populations. Upon completion, our study will validate and characterize germline
genetic factors associated with risk of MGUS and progression to MM in both EAs and AAs. It will have high
impact, providing insight to MGUS and MM etiology and informing genetic contributions to clinical risk models
for progression for the millions of people living with MGUS.",SUCCESS

Cells have evolved complex machinery for both the replication of DNA and for repairing errors in
DNA. Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV) is a large double strand DNA virus that replicates in the
nucleus of the host cell and commandeers some of this host replication machinery. Despite
decades of study, the mechanisms of HSV DNA replication are still poorly understood. The
incoming genome contains nicks and gaps, and it is not known when or if these are repaired in
relation to the timing of DNA synthesis. HSV encodes seven essential DNA replication proteins
including an origin binding protein, a single strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (ICP8), a three-
subunit helicase/primase (UL5/UL8/UL52), and a two-subunit polymerase (UL30/UL42). In
addition, HSV also encodes a two-unit recombinase consisting of a 5'-3' exonuclease (UL12) that
functions with ICP8. Isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) is a powerful tool to study DNA
replication because it allows for the specific purification of replication forks away from bulk
chromatin. When coupled with SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)-based
quantitative proteomics, the iPOND-SILAC-MS method provides a robust, unbiased discovery
tool to identify fork associated proteins by determining the intensity of proteins in a pulse sample
compared to a chase sample. We have utilized iPOND-SILAC-MS to generate robust data sets
of the protein composition of HSV replication forks and replication forks lacking UL12. In the
absence of UL12 a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme, USP15, is not recruited to replication forks.
USP15 interacts directly with UL12 and is required for efficient HSV replication. In addition to viral
proteins, many cellular proteins are enriched on viral replication forks. In twelve iPOND-SILAC-
MS we have identified 200-300 proteins (viral and host) enriched on HSV DNA replication forks.
 The overall goal of this research proposal is to identify the host proteins associated with
viral DNA to generate a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of HSV DNA
replication. To this end we will address three overlapping research areas in my laboratory: 1)
Characterize the physical interaction of UL12 with USP15, 2) Identify the human replisome
proteins required for HSV DNA replication, 3) Determine the fate of the nicks and gaps in the
incoming viral genome.",SUCCESS

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), delaying initiation of treatment for ≥12 weeks is associated with irreversible joint
damage due to greater difficulty in achieving remission, but navigating the hurdles of the US healthcare system
in this short timeframe can be challenging. Time-consuming logistical steps must be carried out to be evaluated
by a qualified specialist, establish a diagnosis, and start antirheumatic drug therapy. These difficulties are
exacerbated for rural residents due to the closure of rural hospitals nationwide extending the distance to
healthcare facilities and the time to travel and obtain care. Additionally, there is very little information about the
timing and accuracy of RA diagnosis and their associated effects on outcomes for rural residents of the US. The
growing rheumatology workforce shortage further aggravates these issues, as <10% of rheumatologists practice
in rural or micropolitan areas yet 30% of the US population lives in these areas. Our goal is to improve outcomes
in patients with RA by reducing healthcare disparities. We aim to (1) identify rural healthcare disparities in the
diagnosis and treatment of early RA, (2) develop and validate an AI algorithm to enable early identification of
RA, and (3) assess long-term outcomes in patients with RA living in rural vs urban areas compared to those
without RA.
We are uniquely positioned to address these objectives as ours is the only population-based, longitudinal RA
inception cohort in the US, and we will extend our cohort to the expanded Rochester Epidemiology Project
catchment area, comprising 27 mixed rural-urban counties in MN and WI (60% rural). This area includes 73 rural
communities where 17 medical facilities have closed in the past 5 years. In addition, we have the only well-
curated database of patients with incident RA, as we manually screen all potential cases of RA to ensure they
meet the American College of Rheumatology/ European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology
(ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA. This is essential for RA research because the diagnostic codes for
RA (especially seronegative RA) are often inaccurate. This research will provide real-world evidence regarding
the magnitude of healthcare disparities in rural residents with RA. Our AI algorithm to facilitate early recognition
of RA will improve clinical practice in three meaningful ways, 1) reducing underdiagnosis of RA in rural primary
care settings, 2) facilitating timely initiation of anti-rheumatic therapies to reduce joint damage and improve long-
term outcomes, and 3) optimizing referrals to rheumatology specialty care to reduce the impact of the workforce
shortage. This work will be foundational for the development of a pragmatic clinical trial testing implementation
of a clinical decision support tool to reduce disparities in early identification of RA. Furthermore, evaluating long-
term outcomes and identifying patient subgroups with the worst outcomes is an important step toward developing
interventions to bridge these gaps in healthcare delivery.",SUCCESS

PD is a complex neurodegenerative disease with a broad spectrum of motor and non-motor features. The
cardinal motor features include resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (or akinesia), and postural instability. Over
the past decade, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has largely replaced ablative techniques in the surgical
Although clinical phenotypes of PD such as tremor dominant (TD) and postural instability and
gait difficulty (PIGD) subtypes have been identified since the mid-1990s, to our knowledge, no
neurobiomarkers have been identified to describe them and assist with decision-making regarding the DBS
therapeutic target.
treatment of PD.
Very limited data exists regarding the electrophysiological abnormalities within the basal
ganglia and associated structures which likely accompany the symptom severity or the phenotypic subtypes of
PD.
This proposal seeks to overcome these limitations by investigating the spatio-spectral dynamics of local field
potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus
internus (GPi) and relate them to symptom manifestations, in an attempt to define the differences in PD motor
phenotypes. In our preliminary studies and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show initial
evidence that high frequency oscillations of microelectrode LFPs and their nonlinear interaction with the beta
band in the form of phase amplitude coupling can distinguish PD motor phenotypes in the territories of STN.
Based on our preliminary observations, this project will investigate these phenotypic LFP patterns in large
patient populations in STN and GPi. Specifically, by employing machine learning techniques, neural signatures
in STN and GPi will be discovered to differentiate motor phenotypes in PD. The project will investigate to what
extent the extracted neural patterns can serve as objective neurobiomarkers to identify the territories of basal
ganglia causing symptom differences. In addition, retrospectively, the project will also explore to what extent
localization of these phenotypic LFP patterns with directional macro electrodes can describe the efficacy of
chronic DBS. If successful, these advancements will provide unique opportunities to understand symptom
manifestation and personalization of DBS in patients with PD.",SUCCESS

Knowledge about lupus is biased towards the severe end of the disease spectrum due to difficulty assembling
population-based cohorts of persons with lupus. An urgent need to expand the basic epidemiologic
understanding of cutaneous and systemic lupus in four content areas (i.e., natural history, treatment, health
care access, and disparities) was identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our project
addresses these needs using the unique research infrastructure of the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP),
which contains longitudinal data on residents of a 27-county region in Minnesota and Wisconsin. We have
assembled population-based cohorts comprised of persons with prevalent and incidence systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) matched to general population comparators
without SLE/CLE by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and county of residence. These cohorts comprise the Lupus
Midwest Network (LUMEN). Through the REP infrastructure, LUMEN follows individuals regardless of
insurance status and encompasses the full spectrum of care, from primary care clinics to tertiary specialty
care, and maintains an electronic index of diagnoses and procedures, including all inpatient and outpatient
encounters, laboratory measures, and drug prescription data. In this competitive renewal of a highly successful
grant investigating multimorbidity in SLE and CLE, opioid pain therapy, and healthcare access and gaps, our
team of researchers and clinicians with decades of experience conducting population-based research will now
focus on new research questions designed to have a high public health impact and to leap forward in our
understanding of the natural history, treatment, healthcare access, and disparities across the full spectrum of
CLE and SLE. Using the LUMEN population-based cohorts, we aim to 1) determine the contributions of lupus
nephritis (LN) and anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) to the excess mortality and unplanned healthcare
utilization (i.e., emergency department visits and hospitalizations) among patients with SLE; 2) determine the
contribution of LN to the excess risk of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction and stroke), infections,
and osteoporosis among patients with SLE; 3) determine access to SLE-specific screening services and
patterns of glucocorticoid use by social determinants of health, age, sex, and race/ethnicity; and 4) determine
the transition rates over time and risk factors for transition from CLE to SLE over four decades to test the
hypothesis that a) most transitions from CLE to SLE occur within five years of the CLE diagnosis, and b) oral
contraceptives or postmenopausal hormone use increase the risk of transitioning from CLE to SLE. These
projects will inform the individualized prognostication of SLE in clearly defined disease phenotypes and inform
interventions to optimize patient care, prevent or reduce adverse outcomes in patients with lupus, and will
identify a window of opportunity in CLE for therapeutic interventions to prevent the transition to SLE.",SUCCESS

This is a supplement to an existing project.","ABSTRACT
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI), NOT-CA-22-057.
Racial disparities exist for multiple myeloma (MM) and its precursor, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS); both MGUS and MM are at least twice as common in Black compared with White
populations, including at younger ages. A similar two-fold increase in MGUS has been seen in a population-
based sample of Black men in Ghana compared to a White reference population, suggesting that the disparity
is similar outside of the US. MGUS also is familial, with 2-3-fold increased prevalence in first-degree relatives
of MM or other hematologic malignancies. Although MGUS is usually benign, it is common in those ages 50
and older, progresses to MM or other lymphoproliferative proliferative disorders at rates of 1-1.5% per year,
and is associated with increased risk of infection, fracture, osteoporosis, renal impairment, and thrombosis,
with resultant morbidity and mortality. Thus, understanding the development of MGUS and MGUS progression
to MM is important, particularly among those with the highest risk, including people of African ancestry (AA)
and first-degree relatives of MM and hematologic disorders. Our parent grant (U01 CA271014) proposes a
comprehensive evaluation of genetic susceptibility to MGUS and MGUS progression to MM using established
epidemiologic and genomic studies. Due to the importance of racial predisposition, for the first time, we
propose to evaluate known MM susceptibility variants and identified novel variants for MGUS and MGUS
progression in an AA population (Parent U01, Aim 3). In this supplement application, we establish a new
global collaboration with Dr. Rotimi at Covenant University in Nigeria to conduct complementary studies of
MGUS in West Africa to enhance the genetic investigations of MGUS and MGUS progression among people of
AA. In Aim 1, we will estimate the prevalence of MGUS using a novel mass spectrometry assay, in two
risk groups ages 40 and older in Nigeria [a community-based sample (N=300) and first-degree relatives
of MM and hematologic cancer patients (N=100)] and compare to US population-based rates. This aim
leverages the experience and existing infrastructure of the Prostate Cancer Transatlantic Consortium network
that recruited over 1000 participants and first-degree relatives, including ten Nigerian clinical sites. In Aim 2, we
will conduct genotyping (GWAS) of MM (N=25), MGUS identified through screening Aim 1 samples (N=66),
and a sample of unaffected participants (N=100) to contribute to the validation of genetic risk factors for
MGUS risk and MGUS progression to MM in AA populations, as proposed in our parent U01. Finally, we
will establish a family study of MGUS, MM and related disorders and perform whole exome sequencing on 25
relatives to identify rare variants. Understanding the prevalence of MGUS and genetic determinants of MGUS
and progression will have high impact for West African populations, as life expectancies continue to see a
steady rise, and more individuals will develop MGUS, MM, and other diseases associated with aging.",SUCCESS
